<span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><div><b>-Ownership of self</b><br/>
-The knowledge that a moral individual owns their body (including mind.)<br/>
-The knowledge that moral love is giving ownership of yourself to another. Not as a slave, but as a companion. A moral love does not involve demands. It involves two individuals that completely willingly give each other to one another. Never for control, only as a completely wanted action for both individuals. A moral love is one in which two individuals benefit completely equally.<br/>
-Immorality regarding ownership of self is giving oneself to the majority. Giving oneself to anyone that does not give back willingly as a result of identical values. Giving oneself the majority is an anonymous transaction, with no currency received.<br/>
-Individuals commit acts of immorality regarding ownership of self when they intentionally wear clothing designed to be sexually attractive, even (ESPECIALLY) when not intended for a specific target, but for anyone that happens to see them. Some base their self-esteem on this action. Their body (and therefore, self) is then owned by whoever happens to see them.
<div>-It is also immoral to give your mind to someone (it would be necessary to say &quot;anyone,&quot; really) regardless of their values. Mind encompassing spirit and soul.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><b>-An aligned existence</b><br/>
-AN IMPORTANT BASIS: every individual, idea, etc is a result of one reality. There is nothing else.
<div><br/></div>
-Contradiction (non aligned) with natural existence results in:<br/>
-Suicide<br/>
-Sadness<br/>
-Eventually leads to apathy - death<br/>
-Physical illness<br/>
-Almost anything negative
<div><br/></div><b>-</b>Body and mind are one. The separation of the two is immoral, including separation of the body and mind in regards to sex and relationships. Sex is an expression of love. Love is a natural state. A bond between two individuals.
<div><br/></div>
Separation of mind and body occurs when there is dissonance between an individual's values and his natural existence. (Example: altruism)
<div><br/></div><div><br/></div>
-Define: soul - the essence and flavor of the human spirit. Being nearly synonyms with &quot;spirit.&quot;
<div><br/></div><div>-Involves the concept that it is not natural for the healthy to maintain those that are weak enough not to survive on their own</div><div><br/></div><div>-Overcoming sickness on one's own is not immoral, it is simply the act of the healthy being slaves to the sick that is immoral.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div>
-<b>The immorality of the School of Psychology</b><br/>
-School of psychology has the goal of holding all humans to a perceived norm, accomplishing the goal by means of chemical medication.<br/>
-Behaviorist school of psychology involves the classification, dissection, and destruction of the human spirit into terms used to map out a manual of the norm.<br/>
-A specific emphasis is put on the school's attitude toward what is called &quot;clinical depression,&quot; which is often simply contradiction. Huge theme: <u><b>contradiction cannot be cured, ignored, or dismissed by medication.</b></u><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><b>Passion</b><br/>
-Passion is moral. Passion is natural.<br/>
-Compromise indicates a lack of passion and contradiction with existence, in that it represents a willingness to &quot;settle&quot; for less than your aspirations. Compromise is extremely immoral.
<div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><b>The immorality of religion - Christianity specifically.</b><br/>
-Altruism<br/>
-The use of the virtue of altruism as a tool to gain power over others. Teach that you must live for others and you're able to bend them to live for you.
<div><br/></div>
Important immoral ideas resulting from/continued by Christianity:
<div><br/></div>
-Altrusim - Your purpose in life is to care for &quot;your brothers,&quot; concern yourself with the lives of everyone around you above your own. Romanticizing altruism.<br/>
Treated as the ultimate moral ideal.
<div><br/></div>
-Ownership of self - Chrisrianity teaches that your body is not your own, but God's.
<div><br/></div>
-Seperation of mind, body, soul - Christianity teaches that your soul is a seperate entity from your body, when they are in fact the same. This mentality leads to dissonance with physical needs, and a general devaluing of the physical form.<br/>
Leads to the hate of one's own desires, another tool of the slavemasters.<br/>
Treating sexual love as something immoral. Platonic relationships glorified as high morality.
<div><br/></div>
Suppression of physical desires leads to contradiction. The only rational purpose of existence is to live for one's own happiness. This is directly contradicted by several interweaving elements of Christianity.
<div><br/></div>
-The destruction of the human spirit perpetrated by Christianity has been going on for centuries.
<div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>The immorality of Feminism or Masculinism</b></div><div>-The immorality of Feminism and Masculinism is built on the foundation that the only way to morally exist is to exist for one's self.  The moral individual fights only for his own rights.  Grouping to demand rights from others is contradictory to natural existence.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>The morality of accountability</b></div><div>-Accountability for one's own actions is necessary to live life as an individual, as an aligned being.</div><div>-A rejection of individual accountability will always mark evil's face.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>The immorality of altruism</b></div><div>-Lots to draw from Christianity (above)</div><div><br/></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>The immorality of government</b></div><div>-Enforcing the morality of the majority on the minority (those that do not share the same morality) at gunpoint.</div><div>-When an entity (be it government or an individual) tells you what you can and cannot do with your body, he has forcibly taken ownership of it.  Includes pro-life laws and laws against suicide, assisted suicide.</div><div>-&quot;You promote a mother's right to end her child's life but squeal if a rational being makes a rational decision not to exist.&quot;</div><div>-The immorality of taxes</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>The immorality of the grief of the human spirit</b></div><div>-Being weak enough to let oneself succumb to his/her surroundings is immoral.  Not taking personal accountability and admitting this weakness is also immoral.  Blaming the destruction of your spirit on anyone else is not moral, but it wouldn't happen, given that the subject would be apathetic by the time their spirit is gone.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>The immorality of compartmentalization</b></div><div>-When an individual accepts that his life is divided into different areas, and that his love and passion can be split between several individuals or causes, he/she is admitting to having multiple individuals living inside the individual, which is not true.</div><div>-Division of one's life (given that life can only have one essential purpose) leads to dissonance with self and contradiction with one's nature.</div><div>-Elizabeth is guilty of compartmentalization.  Her purpose is stretched too thin, as is her love.  She is not able to love Aaron Hunt because she cannot let go of her father.  (And also because she recognizes that he is owned by his wife.)</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div></div></span>
