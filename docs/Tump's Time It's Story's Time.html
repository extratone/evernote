<span><div>Mention Rand</div><div>Tump is TV, incarnate, and they're both dying</div><div>A stress test of the Office.</div><div>Punk is the fountain of youth.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>There are many reasons - some obvious, some not - why political and ideological discourse will never be a part of <i>Extratone</i>, editorially. Redundancy, primarily, coupled with a lack of any useful authority in the workings of functional, sovereign operations, on my part. But - though mine may be aloof and irrelevant - I cannot ignore the unique, authentically-youthful perspectives offered by the staff &amp; community on some very significant questions that are being asked as a direct result of the United States' 45th Presidency.</div><div><br/></div><div>As such, I have created <i>Tump</i> - this standalone section - to present what of them we articulate for any interested readers. However, it will not be listed in any sitebound navigation, meaning its only two gateways are through 1)piggybacking on content with independent value and 2)direct link, meaning you'll only see it if you <i>seek it out</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>That stated, allow me to contradict myself.</div><hr/><div>Frankly, after hearing Jake Tapper sincerely ask &quot;are we [CNN] 'fake news?,'&quot; I am <i>desperate</i> to do whatever possible to ensure I never have to repeat the experience.</div><div><br/></div><div>I am therefore required - in little authority or relevance - to talk about the <i>breadth</i> of the cultural impact of The Fact of Tump, especially on the Grand Old Church of American journalism.</div><div><br/></div><div>He is the least <i>Presidential</i> individual to ever occupy the White House, which - from what I've gathered - is a sentiment shared by the majority of Americans. Those Donnie supporters I've been exposed to over the past 4-5 months have all expressed a respect - an inconcealable <i>need</i>, even - for his <b>honesty</b>. In September, I published a <a href="https://medium.com/@AsphaltApostle/a-hasty-case-for-an-ingenuine-white-house-9476aedd73ae#.1lishwe2o">hasty plea</a> for reflection on the dangerous and misplaced power of this craving - my first political words, ever. At the time, I decided it was not appropriate or desirable for me to say such a thing with <i>Extratone</i>, but we have an honest President, now, and there is nothing he'll not eventually touch.</div><div><br/></div><div>Yes, I have been consuming the news. Like many, in a wider stream than ever, and you're right! In inauguration sizes, analysis of the media's coverage of terrorist attacks, and all manner of other googlable narratives, he is <i>Hawking Huge Hokum</i>, but his lies are obviously not designed to be believed, which makes them something else entirely.</div><div><br/></div><div>What makes him <i>honest</i>, though, is actually the precise opposite. His consistent &amp; obvious lack of discipline should reassure those of you concerned about integrity in a profound way. Idiots are more trustworthy the more ridiculous they are, yeah? It is tremendously inefficient to be a spectacular crony.</div><div><br/></div><div>There was such a desire for <i>honesty</i> in this country that some of the most reasonable, hard-working, and pragmatic people I've ever known were willing to accept the consequences of bowing to a circus in order to finally guarantee that their President is <i>incapable</i> of anything but transparency.</div><div><br/></div><div>What has <i>not</i> been in doubt these past three weeks: Tump has set immediately upon the talking points he carried with him around the country throughout his campaign. at best speed. He may even have set a record for it; I know he did for the fastest-dropping approval rating.</div><hr/><div><b>But how and why did this happen, again?</b></div><div><i>Extratone</i> has a love for counterculture because it is the most essential endeavor to youth's furthering of progress. I'm supposed to be pretty good at differentiating between it and its popular compliment, so let's hope this is worthwhile.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Tump's Presidency is counterculture</b> in a sense that eases the working-class famishment for righteousness in top-tier power. Or at least, that's the idea. Just seconds into his seat, he was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384774/trump-microphone-speech-long-neck-shure-sm57">spiting the conventions</a> of inaugural address delivery. He is there to break ridiculous records, make us all uncomfortable, and embarrass the shit out of the country - except for those few young people who've mistaken his shtick for <b>punk</b>. Their way of thought and its plenty of misconceptions is the most frightening component of the whole situation.</div><div><br/></div><div>I know punks; they don't like Tump.</div><div><br/></div><div>If I may presume to define it - <b>Punk</b> is counterculture with a broadly pro-culture motive. Punks appear as caricatures because - whether they care to acknowledge it or not - they use their abrasion with society to keep it moving. It is a <i>necessary</i> function in the development and ongoing maintenance of any community. It is the true-to-life <i>fountain of youth</i>. Unfortunately, because all of us carry this knowledge at some depth, internally, it is often misused to justify outward tantrums from personal trauma. In most cases, like <i>BratShit</i>'s Milo Yiiiii, all parties (including the nesting mind, itself) are deceived. And Tump - especially when taken from the dominantly-relevant perspective of technology - is old. He is television, incarnate - an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/president-trump-white-house.html?_r=0">antiliterate</a> President who spends hours a day forgoing the renaissance happening around him for <i>The Tube</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>When one assumes this crusade in ignorance, he writes &amp; says things that will embarrass him for a lifetime. I would know. </div><div>(I'll share that story one day, when I have the courage.)</div><div><br/></div><div>Tump is not quite the type to do so, if you believe <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1048/donald-trump-can-t-stand-mckay-coppins">McKay Coppins</a>, but regardless of his intentions, the task has been placed wholly upon him, and he's made it clear that he is a natural, but he will never be punk. It's impossible without youth, and Tump is old, especially when observed from the dominantly-relevant perspective of technology. He is television, incarnate - an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/president-trump-white-house.html?_r=0">antiliterate</a> President who spends hours a day forgoing the renaissance happening around him for <i>The Tube</i>.</div><div><hr/></div><div>I've never needed to pay attention to moderate politics, so I'm not sure how long the White House's YouTube channel has been streaming its daily press briefings, but I'm highkey liberal in day-to-day life, now, thanks to recent events, and have been watching as many as I can. I find Sean Spicer's movements and speech infinitely fascinating, for whatever reason, and am much too amused when the <a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/829402944814596100">Twitter press</a> calls him &quot;Spicey.&quot; </div><div><br/></div><div>I think the fact of these compulsions is relevant because they echo what's happening to readership in the whole of the country. Though it's a few centuries late, at least Americans are <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sales-orwells-1984-following-trump-inauguration-propel-novel-top-amazon-bestseller-list-1603035">reading</a> more science fiction. Ya know... the literary movement designed specifically to incite speculation and prepare you for this sorta thing. (Or prevent it, entirely.)</div><div><br/></div><div>In this first chapter of Tump's presidency, the press have been the heroes, and it is American Journalism as an ethical and functional whole that will endure the most significant torment and triumph in the next four years.</div><div><br/></div><div>Democracy rewards stupidity; the industry means to kill it, dead. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></span>
