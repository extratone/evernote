<span><div>     Title: Assuming Vapor</div><div><br/></div><div>Talking about vape culture without sounding like a heretic or hypocrite is probably going to be a great labor for me, but I feel like it needs to be done. My writings will always be non structured to begin with, that's just how I write. Even though I have my title of Prose Editor, I myself, do very little editing. I leave the big stuff to David. As I am starting to work on this writing, I can feel that it will be long and drawn out piece,it will by no doubt of the imagination have an endless amount of run on sentence, grammatical errors and areas where some of my readers may become lost. This is how I think, and my writings are my thoughts in a more physical setting where I can better see them laid out and show them to others in a manner where I don’t sound completely like a madman/asshole. Sorry to run off topic, but I feel that this should be stated for most of my work till people have a knowledge that this is how things are going to be when they read a Leo Marx writing. So back to the topic on hand.</div><div><br/></div><div>Vaping.</div><div><br/></div><div>When many people think of vaping or vapers, some ideas come to mind if they themselves are not a person who uses an electronic nicotine delivery system. I’m going to go off on a limb here, and I'm fairly certain that it's a very sturdy limb, that the ideas people have about vaping and vapers are wrong assumptions.</div><div><br/></div><div>What is an assumption?</div><div><br/></div><div>To me personally, what I think an assumption is, is an idea that someone constructs in their mind about something or someone or a situation and this idea is not necessarily based on fact. It's more of an opinion, something that one thinks they know but might not actually be the reality of situation, and this is why I believe most assumptions are bad. They, the assumer, stereotype and pre decide without full knowledge of a situation or person and how “it” is. When someone assumes something, I think that they are deciding that the knowledge they have is the reality of the situation, and this is when an assumption becomes dangerous. Furthermore, for some reason I dislike using that word, not sure why.</div><div><br/></div><div>Back to the topic. People often make what they would call a safe assumption, an assumption that is believed to not cause harm or hurt on the subject being assumed. This to me is still an assumption none the less, and as I have seen and experienced, being on both ends of a safe assumption, many times a safe assumptions can be proven to be wrong, or at least from what I have seen it can be, this statement in and of itself could be an assumption, but nevermind that. Sometimes an assumption maybe right, this is only sometimes and is not the point of my rambling. The point here is the fact that people make many assumptions about vaping, vapers and the vape community. From what I know many of these assumptions are not true, they may be true to small groups of people, but for the majority they are not the reality of the situation. I won't get into the decision of what reality is for this writing, I, myself don't have time for that discussion or the will to explain my opinion on it.</div><div><br/></div><div>Why are there assumptions and misconceptions about vaping?</div><div><br/></div><div>I’m not completely sure why people make assumptions about vaping and people who vape. I think it might come from a misunderstanding, some negative stereotypes, and how new the activity of vaping is.</div><div><br/></div><div>As far as I can tell vaping is still some what in its adolescence, only really coming to the world in the late 2000’s. Well that is almost 10 year as of writing this, but 10 years isn’t that long in the world of drugs and pharmaceutical products, or so I think. Most people who vape would consider the current generation of devices fairly new, and there is a constant force of development behind this technology. From someone who started vaping just 3 years ago much has changed in the over all realm of vaping. Short and simply, vaping is a new thing, and I’m without a doubt sure this is why there is a stigma surrounding it. This I feel is true about most things, such as automotives, music, and computer technology. When hybrid cars came on the market there was and still very much is a stereotype for the people that purchase and drive them. This is and will continue to happen to vaping. This is not a new concept, it's been covered and talked about plenty of times before, I am only bring it up because I feel there should be a change of mind and attitude to vaping and all things that are new. That being said, I'm not advocating that anyone should go and pick up a black box that delivers nicotine to the lungs and start puffing away.</div><div><br/></div><div>So what the hell is vaping and who is doing it?</div><div><br/></div><div>I, myself am no authority on vaping, what opinion I have on vaping comes from my own experience with vaping and the vape community. So to me simple put vaping is an alternative form of ingesting nicotine. However, there is much more to vaping then that like all things. There are a number of people (I’m really not sure the exact number, and don't care to look for it) who use vapes that have no nicotine in the liquid they inhale. Be this because they have weaned themselves off of nicotine and haven't dropped the habit of smoking/vaping or they vape to be part of a community and like as they say in the vape community “blowing fat clouds.” These two examples of vapers are vague in the description of who these people are in life. This is where the assumptions and stereotypes start coming into play.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think most people from what I have seen and heard assume the guy that likes to blow fat clouds falls into the stereotype of a bro or “douche bag”. This stereotype is sometimes true, that is why the stereotype exist, but I have often seen it to be extremely false. I have meet and know a good deal of men and women who are very much not the bro stereotype and enjoy the activity of cloud chasing or as a bro may say, unironically, “blowing them fat clouds.” The reason why they enjoy it? I myself am not completely sure.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can only say that I did this because I thought it was extremely funny turning myself into a human smoke machine while making steam locomotive noises. There are many types of people who vape, and they all have their own reasons why. The main reason I have seen people started vaping is that they wanted to stop or cut back on smoking. Why this is a good reason is currently up for debate in the health science community, and this will continue to be till long term studies are done on vaping. In general as far as I can tell from a handful of short studies done on vaping, vaping is a safer alternative to smoking tobacco cigarettes.</div><div><br/></div><div>How much safer? I'm not sure, from one article I saw about a year ago from Public Health England it was said to be 95% safer. To me this sounds a tad fairy talish, but I am a sceptic of many things. That said, I still continue to use a vape as my nicotine source. I could now cover the many types of people who vape and the reasons, but being a person with the need to talk about myself, I’ll talk about myself.</div><div><br/></div><div>I started vaping purely on the idea that I thought vaping looked cyberpunk, something that was Blade Runner-esc. I didn’t do it to cut back from smoking, that only happen as of late 2016. Awhile after I started vaping, I found myself enjoying the technical side of it, the science of making fat clouds in a safe way.</div><div><br/></div><div>I found a hobby in building coils and trying to better my craftsmanship in it, this though only lasted about a year. I stopped vaping more or less for the next year. Then in late 2016 I decided to start vaping once more to stop smoking cigarettes, this choice only because I want to live a healthier and longer life, solely on the principle to play more video games and to consume more internet content.</div><div><br/></div><div>The reason I tell my experience and opinions on vaping is that I hope I can change the idea people have about vaping and vapers themselves, but I think I may have stated that earlier. If the reader has made it this far I sincerely want thank them for the sure effort that they must have put into reading my thoughts, I know it was most likely not the an easy or fun task, all due to my lack of composition skills. So, to finish things off before I make a novel out of this, remember, don’t assume the vapor.</div></span>
