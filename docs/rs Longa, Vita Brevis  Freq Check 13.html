Our landing pages have matured colorfully, and the template has been virtually perfected. Elements can now be reordered, spawned, or removed in seconds, without necessitating adjustment of others.</div><div><br/></div><div>I told you <a href="http://bit.ly/freq12" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">last month</a> that my gift to <i>Extratone</i> for its first birthday would be a <a href="http://extratone.com/masthead" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bespoke masthead</a>. I’ve included it below this letter.</div><div><img src="rs Longa, Vita Brevis  Freq Check 13_files/Image.png" type="image/png" data-filename="Image.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin: 5px; max-height: 500px; vertical-align: middle; height: auto;"/></div><div><hr style="width: 100%;height: 1px;font-size: 1px;border-bottom: 1px solid #c1c7cd;display: inline-block;"/></div><div><h2>Editorially</h2></div><div>It’s unfortunate that <i>I</i> of all people have been and will continue to be responsible for <i>branding</i> in the near future. I’ve never been a very good salesman, and the language I’ve contributed to <i>Extratone</i>’s brand image has often been criticized as ostentatious: <a href="http://bit.ly/scribam" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the latin mantra</a>, staff-given titles, and my use of legacy journo words like “masthead.” Until last week, the short description on our <a href="http://twitter.com/extratone" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com/extratonemagazine" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/extratone" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, <a href="http://extratone.com/anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Anchor station</a>, etc. was copied from the beginning of our <a href="http://extratone.com/about" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">About page</a>, and dated back to the first few days of the project.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>An online magazine covering technology, music, culture, and media from an exclusively-youthful perspective.</i></div><div><br/></div><div>Ugh.</div><div><br/></div><div>It doesn’t sound like a very fun place, does it? I’ve been pitifully devoid of alternative descriptors to “youth” or “fresh.” The most apt summary I’ve come across is that of <a href="https://thelast-magazine.com/info/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i>The Last Magazine</i></a> and well… I can’t use that now, can I?</div><div><br/></div><div>I <i>did</i> come up with something, thanks to Anchor. (The old one wouldn’t fit.) I want you to try it on for size.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ready?</div><div><br/></div><div><b><i>An online magazine for the new curious.</i></b></div><div><br/></div><div>As in, those individuals possessing a <i>new curiosity</i>. Or, perhaps - those new individuals who are curious.</div><div><br/></div><div>My hope is that it is not passed over because of its vagueness, at first glance - that the reader, in asking these questions internally, if only for a moment, will arrive at a significantly more precise conception than the old one lent to, but I am notoriously confusing, so I will always welcome <a href="http://extratone.com/bilge" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">your suggestions</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>I’ll be honest with you - I wasn’t entirely happy with the idea of a digital-only future for <i>Extratone</i>, but I’d conceded to the reality I was sure of, given my experience: the only print magazines worth circulation will be those that began that way.</div><div><br/></div><div>However, Hawthorn - with significantly more experience occupying the Northwestern U.S. - insists that our prospects for pure circulation in the Portland and Seattle area are actually <i>better</i> in print. Apparently, that’s how things are done there.</div><div><br/></div><div>It’s still a pipe dream to be able to one day smell my creation, albeit less of one.</div><div><br/></div><div><a href="http://bit.ly/thetone" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i>The Tone</i></a> has gotten itself into a bit of a rhythm of subjects - <b>DIVISION</b>, <b>ART</b>, and <b>MEDIA</b>. Did ya notice?</div><div><img src="rs Longa, Vita Brevis  Freq Check 13_files/Image [1].png" type="image/png" data-filename="Image.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin: 5px; max-height: 500px; vertical-align: middle; height: auto;"/></div><div><hr style="width: 100%;height: 1px;font-size: 1px;border-bottom: 1px solid #c1c7cd;display: inline-block;"/></div><div><h2>Audio</h2></div><div>I had a feeling that Anchor’s company culture would be a good match for ours, but I did <i>not</i> expect to receive an email from them, asking to feature our station. They were tremendously kind and patient, even when I screwed up a bit of legal language and didn’t respond for 15 hours. I was given a choice between the Tech, Music, and Culture channels. I thought music made the most sense. Feel free to <a href="mailto:davidblue@extratone.com" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">kick my ass</a> if you disagree. We were also encouraged to continue using “other elements,” and told that “variety is always a good thing,” which is obviously very freeing and on-brand as hell.</div><div><br/></div><div>It’s been a fun three weeks. Subscribers can listen to the archives of our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/archived-our-day-11592398" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">first full-scheduled day</a>, Hawthorn’s <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/archived-summer-11609737" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i>Summer of Digital Heartbreak 2017</i></a> playlist, and Tim’s <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/archived-tims-11643732" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ultra-cool indie dive</a>. </div><div><br/></div><div>The Anchor community has already been unbelievably welcoming and supportive, including <a href="https://twitter.com/mayafish" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Maya</a> (who originally contacted me and put up with my negligence,) <a href="https://twitter.com/gmanteer" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grant</a> (who hosts <a href="https://anchor.fm/potd" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i>Podcast of the Day</i></a> on Anchor and was the first intelligible caller on the station,) and many other already-memorable names who’ve consistently listened to and ‘applaud’ed our radio content despite its… breadth.</div><div><hr style="width: 100%;height: 1px;font-size: 1px;border-bottom: 1px solid #c1c7cd;display: inline-block;"/></div><div><h2>Mechanically</h2></div><div>Astonishingly, I think I found an almost-compelling reason for us to have a Facebook page… A MailChimp-integrated Email tab!</div><div><br/></div><div>Wow. </div><div><br/></div><div>I don’t think I’ve <i>actually</i> seen a useful application for Pages before. This is a huge milestone. Please be sure to select/tap/click that &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/thetonefb" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Newsletter</a>&quot; tab with haste.</div><div><img src="rs Longa, Vita Brevis  Freq Check 13_files/Image [2].png" type="image/png" data-filename="Image.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin: 5px; max-height: 500px; vertical-align: middle; height: auto;"/></div><div>Also, I have revised the site-bound <a href="http://extratone.com/email" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">signup page</a> and <a href="http://www.extratone.com/june12/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">frontpage element</a>, as well. </div></div><div><br/></div></span>
