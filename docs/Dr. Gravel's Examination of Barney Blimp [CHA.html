<span><div>Dr. William Gravel's initial examination of </div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">DR. GRAVEL</span>: Good afternoon, Mr. Blimp, I am Dr. William Gravel - resident here at St. Nicholas. At this point, I'd like to ask you a few prelim questions, if that's alright with you. How are you feeling today?</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">BARNEY BLIMP</span>: Hello, Bill. Turn off the fucking TV, please.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">DR. GRAVEL</span>: ...I'm sorry?</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">DR. GRAVEL</span>: At this point, I'm going to ask you a few questions that may seem a bit silly, but it's important that you try to answer them honestly and accurately, okay? We can laugh about them, no problem, but I need serious answers from you, if you can, okay?</div><div><br/></div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 8px; font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); border-top-left-radius: 4px; border-top-right-radius: 4px; border-bottom-right-radius: 4px; border-bottom-left-radius: 4px; background-color: rgb(251, 250, 248); border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14902); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;-en-codeblock:true;"><div>“Boop!” said a damp voice from ahead. Cold bone pushed on Barney’s nose and it all went black and under, then yellow again. He sniffled and it was rubber – the odor of a high school gym. “Boop!” again, and the breath was louder, but he shot open his eyes and grabbed the bone. It was an unhealthily yellowed index finger attached to a strangely-balding man above him with a graph paper collar, grinning gray teeth, and a cleft chin.</div><div>“Good morning, Barney, my friend,” he said. “It is that time for you to awaken.”</div><div>“Egch,” was all the reply he was obliged, for the abdomen ache had been mortally enlarged and was again returning – with its grimacing victim – to life. Barney involuntarily abandoned his hold on the man’s finger to hold with both hands his own tortured middle.</div><div>“Fuck. Ow,” he groaned.</div><div>“There he is, BJ, the winner of the Eastminster Kennel Club’s Best in Show Award…”</div><div>In front of his clutched stomach and the white floral slopes of his blanketed knees and feet was the hellish appliance – the tiny, cracked television, now strapped on top of a distressed black metallic cart with the wide dirty yellow band of a tow rope, placed so close as to be in apparent contact with the foot of his hospital bed, which had been wheeled into a windowless, much more sinister space. The tiles of the ceiling were stained all over and the faded custard wallpaper was contemptuously torn in the far corner from the obscured doorway behind a gigantic, crosshatched pile of wooden and blue plastic clipboards that filled most of the unevenly lit floor space – certainly taking up half as much again the space made for Barney Blimp and company.</div><div>“A great-looking dog.”</div><div>“He walks like a winner.”</div><div>“For God’s sake… Who… the hell… are… you people?” he asked with great effort, wincing through his teeth. The yellowed man had turned his daft, gray grin away and flipped through the crisp paper sheets on the clipboard in his forearm’s crook, pausing to belch once, twice, and thrice, churning his chin into many again and again with his nodding.</div><div>“Barney, wow… It’s good to see you up and at’em again, eh?... I’m Dr. Bill, a resident psychiatrist here at St. Nicolas General.”</div><div>…</div><div>“Dr… Bill-”</div><div>“…Dr. William Gravel, that is.”</div><div>…</div><div>“Why… have I been moved? What… the hell is this room? The pain…”</div><div>Dr. Gravel looked his way again with unsettlingly white eyes, belching under his breath, emptily grinning.</div><div>“Ah, well, this is Clipboard Locker three, you see… Didn’t think these just appeared willy nilly outa thin air, didja? Aha,” he laughed hollowly and briefly held up his board in displayed emphasis before licking quickly his fingers in that foulest of fingery quick-licking ticks found in far too many of the most off-putting people, returning them then to vile scrunching and rubbing of what was presumably Barney Blimp’s medical chart.</div><div>“At this point,” he said, chin retreating in another emission, “we moved you here, you see… because there seemed to be a problem when we tried to run your insurance, I’m afraid.”</div><div>“You… what? You… can’t… you can’t do that?”</div><div>…</div><div>“Oh jeez, I’m really sorry Barney, buddy… At this point, I’m afraid we can’t give you anything more for the pain until you answer a few questions for me… Don’t worry, though, we will get it all figured out in no time at all.”</div><div>“…The former General raw and red-eyed as he defended the President…”</div><div>“At this point… I’d like to formalize things, if you don’t mind,” said Dr. Gravel, belching and clicking his ballpoint repeatedly after dismounting it from the board. “Uh… Give me just a moment… uhhuh.”</div><div>“…Good morning, Geoff…”</div><div>The doctor marched around the bed, scooting and flattening himself between the TV cart and the decrepit wall, briefly disappearing behind the cover of a filthy old-fashioned hospital screen to produce a rolling chair with matching white leather upholstery.</div><div>“…The driver, look at this…”</div><div>Both the hinges and the cracking cushion creaked as he sat, leaning at once much too far back, then regaining balance with his lifted legs and a loathsome “whoopsie!” Barney Blimp, still clutching, set to sucking in a great, to-capacity breath.</div><div>“TURN OFF THE FUCKING…” he screamed.</div><div>“Hello, aha,” said Dr. Gravel, with his chins and his belching.</div><div>…</div><div>“Good afternoon, Mr. Blimp, I am Dr. William Gravel, resident psychiatrist at St. Nicolas. At this point, I’d like to conduct your initial examination interview, if that’s alright with you. How are you feeling today?”</div><div>“Hello, Bill. Turn off the fucking TV please.”</div><div>…</div><div>“I’m sorry?”</div><div>“For the love of God, turn off the fucking television… Right there!” yelled Barney, sitting up with all his effort, indicating with both outstretch hands to the blabbering set at his feet, palms pleading toward the ceiling stains, “RIGHT THERE… TURN. IT. OFF.”</div><div>“Gee, Barney…” said Dr. Gravel, following his patient’s desperately distressed eyes, “I can’t really do that at this point, I’m afraid… That TV is part of this whole regimen… You need it! You need it to feel better.” He and his chins belched on his board and again his fingers performed the quick-licking tick. Barney Blimp – having exhausted the energy he had saved in his rage – flopped back in on his unfulfilling pillows, moaning.</div><div>“We’ve got what looks to be a… Ha ha, well… a miniature trough of chili right here in front of us. Wow!...”</div><div>“At this point,” belch, licking tick, “I'm going to ask you a few questions that may seem a bit silly, but it's important that you try to answer them honestly and accurately, okay? We can laugh about them, no problem, but the actual answers from you need to be serious ones, if you can, okay?”</div><div>“…Yes, that’s an understandable contrast to make, Jack…”</div><div>“Let’s begin with your name. Can you tell me your full name?”</div><div>…</div><div>“Barney… Barry… Blimp,” he answered, clutching his middle again and looking serenely at the front of Theodore Pith’s t-shirt on the TV with just his neck.</div><div>“Excellent, Barney… Okay, now… Today’s date?”</div><div>…</div><div>“Barney?... The date, buddy.”</div><div>…</div><div>“Saturday… March tenth.”</div><div>“Perfect,” said Dr. Gravel, belching and scribbling with his crude, scratching instrument.</div><div>…</div><div>“And, can you tell me where we are now?”</div><div>…</div><div>Amidst a chorus of agony and new epiphany, Barney laid back flat and began shuffling downward toward the cart by gyrating his hips.</div><div>…</div><div>“Barney, can you tell me where you are? Maybe what this room is?”</div><div>…</div><div>Grunting and breathlessly cursing, the shuffling progressed steadily and Barney’s feet soon escaped the floral sheets, exposed toes touching the cold metal cart.</div><div>“…Well, there it is… You’ve got to love that humor!...”</div><div>“Alrighty, then, why don’t we come back to that one? No problem at all, buddy… How about the President? Can you tell me who the President is right now?”</div><div>…</div><div>Satisfied with his distance from the box and grimacing, Barney dug in his elbows and pushed against the towering black object of his torture with the gowned-above-the-knees might and unabashed howling of childbirth, tipping it insufficiently at first, then allowing it to swing back against the bed before adding all available gumption to the assisting action of his knees.</div><div>“…What kind of a shirt is that?...” asked Jaime Jangles in finality as she fell back out of Barney’s sight with the thing, crashing, buzzing, and then entirely quieting, to his short-lived relief.</div><div>…</div><div>“Whoopsie!” belched Dr. Gravel.</div></div><div><br/></div></span>
