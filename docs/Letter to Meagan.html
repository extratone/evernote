Meagan,

	
	<div><br/></div>
	
	<div>     I know that you told Kailin you never wanted to speak to me again, but I also know that you honor your promises. While the chance to respond to your list is not an agreement, I'm asking you with all of my heart to read and contemplate this entire letter, not just for my benefit - I think for yours also. You told me you were ending it for you, and I'm glad. With this letter, I don't intend to evoke pity or beg. Though I am tremendously confused and upset, the decision to leave is ultimately yours, and I will do my best to leave you alone if my proposal means nothing to you. (It should be noted now that I will NEVER come to your house without your permission, and if we encounter each other in public, I will not approach you if you don't wish it. As difficult as it is to have this conversation, and as upset as I am, I want you to know that I do not wish to make you uncomfortable, though the thought of you reacting that way to my presence is impossible for me to fathom.)</div>
	
	<div>     Honestly, I didn't see this coming at all. I had no idea we'd ever be here, at this point. I couldn't and can't comprehend you never wanting to speak to me. Not to be pitiful, but I feel like the baby in an expressionless mother test. I don't know how you feel about me, truly. Up until Thursday, I didn't know anything had changed. As you can imagine, this experience has only been confusing and terrifying. I don't want to upset you, but I'd like to clarify it in my perspective.</div>
	
	<div>     I woke up on Thursday to Gus barking and my phone ringing. I answered, you explained that you were upstairs, and I came to let you in. You seemed stressed, but I knew what was going on with school and Erin. When you mentioned you were breaking up, I went into a sort of shock. Having just woke up, I couldn't really comprehend what I was hearing. When you were done going down the list, you asked if I had anything to say. I was - honestly - too stunned to form words. That memory has been on a loop in my mind since then. I would give anything to be there again, to have said what I should've said long before this was ever allowed to happen. After you left, I sat for a moment staring off into space before letting out a scream. I ran after you but by the time I was upstairs, Kailin's car was already turning out of the cul de sac.</div>
	
	<div>     Another moment I keep seeing: our first kiss. Do you remember? I can't help but replay it and wonder - again - how we got here. I've been with you my entire adult life and I am struggling to function without pictures of Cecil, good morning texts, or the simple knowledge you are out there somewhere, willing to listen if I need you. </div>
	
	<div>     I've been mulling over what could make me worth so little to you and you know what? I get it. For a long time, I have been using our relationship as an excuse, and behaving like your baby. I'm sure it must've felt stupidly needy and annoying. Like I had just become just another burden to you; another obligation. And what do I add to your life if I'm just another obligation? In such a stressful time, with so many people depending on you, I can understand how offloading this one would be a good option.</div>
	
	<div>     I think I took you for granted, and let myself go. I cited our relationship and its lack of reciprocity as the reason I stopped taking care of myself. I felt as though I was special because I had this special quality in me - that relationships were more important to me than other people, and that I was just such a sad sight. </div>
	
	<div>     If there's one thing I've realized in the past few days, it's that I am not exempt from the responsibilities, sensibilities, and practices of &quot;normal&quot; people, but that I have been living with that belief for a long time. The traditions of a relationship - exchanging gifts, candy, flowers, going out to eat, etc - I let myself off because I believed my way was enough. This was part of the same thinking, I think, that shut you out, and prevented me from being an emotional support system. I also excused it because, frankly, I didn't think you wanted me for support over your friends. I realize now that I should've fought more for the right, listened better, and let go of any criticism.</div>
	
	<div>     In essence, I stopped putting effort into us. Maybe I assumed you'd always be there? I forgot the importance of all the things we did in the beginning. This, in tandem with the guilt I conjured in you, is I think why you also gave up. I think we slipped into a pattern of just tolerating each other. I don't know if you've even wanted to see me at all the past few months - I guess not.</div>
	
	<div>     The guilt is perhaps my biggest mistake, and the biggest change I think we could make. I used to get upset at all sorts of things - when you'd hang out with anyone else, when you wanted to go on a trip, when you were concerned about your family or friends. And you know what? That was freakin' immaturity, nothing more. No special quality that made me a super sad, insatiable baby, just self-pity. Perhaps the biggest reason I have been so insistent to contact you, to get one word in, is that this has changed in me, especially in the past year. </div>
	
	<div>     Maybe it's growing up, smarting up, or whatever, but I do not feel upset when you need to see your friends anymore. I haven't gotten upset at all when you preferred time with other people - I have gained the ability to understand and accept. I realized that yes, sometimes things aren't ideal between us, especially in how differently we feel about each other, but that you were worth it. I knew that I loved you too much - loved your ability to love and be loved by so many other people, and that ultimately, one of your compartments was just for me. </div>
	
	<div>     Brent's friendship also helped me understand this. Mom's support of me through this has furthered it more still. I've made the transition - recently - from trying to fit my relationship model on you, to just loving being in a relationship with you. I'm not just lying in an effort to get you back, I promise. I have genuinely made huge changes in the past year. After the amount of thought I've put into this the past few days, I am very proud of it. </div>
	
	<div>     Again, this is why I was so desperate to contact you. I know that an immature, reactionary, guilt-tripping burden is not worth your time. For whatever reason, I never sat you down to tell that I <i>had</i> become someone worth your time. I think it was because I had yet to think about it in a general sense, I had only made small observations over time. I should've vocalized it. I had forgotten how guilty I made you. Perhaps, if I had just realized it sooner and told you, you could have been released - and we would never have had to face this event. </div>
	
	<div>     Unfortunately, I have also been unusually bitter in the past year. I guess I felt sorry for myself? I took you for granted and couldn't see what a different person you needed. I didn't vocalize my feelings to you because they were all invested in you - I know now that this can't be healthy, and that I need to acknowledge my inescapable humanity. I was able to spend Christmas really interacting with my family for the first time - another thing I was very proud of. And, you know what's really stupid? As much elitism and pride as I exhibited, I've been proud of how I've been becoming more and more like you. More willing to listen, to recognize the people that care about me, and to acknowledge them. You've been teaching me to have a normal life, and for that, I am very grateful.</div>
	
	<div>     I blamed you, the most important thing in my life, for my bitterness and excused myself from living, really. And good God, why would you ever want to marry that? I can see why we're at a stalemate - because I left us there. While I can't claim to be a totally new person after only 4 days of grief, I can claim to be a lot closer to both the David you first met and fell in love with, and adult David.</div>
	
	<div>     I can only imagine this break in contact is an effort to be strong, to permanently end us, to remain immune from my efforts to persuade you to come back. And you know what? I agree with it. I want the old us to be over. It wasn't good for either of us. I believe, though, that there is a possibility for a new us, with a benefit to both. I don't want to sucker you into babying me again - I want us to start over. I believe that I have genuinely matured enough that you could fall in love with me again, if you allow yourself the chance. I can only hope that you won't delete or rip up this letter immediately, and that you will see in me something that's worth your time. I hope that it's not too late.</div>
	
	<div><br/></div>
	
	<div>Take as much time as you need. I won't pretend that I'm not suffering, but I also respect your right to space. If you do decide to contact me about this, I ask that it be not in guilt or pity, but in desire. I know there's still some there.</div>
	
	<div><br/></div>
	
	<div>I want to be a part of your life, Meagan. But this time, I want to be worthy of you. I want to be someone you can talk to. I'm worth a second chance.</div>
	
	<div><br/></div>
	
	<div><br/></div>
	
	<div><br/></div>
	
	<div>I can only hope this convinces you that I am worth giving another chance. </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>-stop with the second chance stuff</div>
	<div>-</div>
