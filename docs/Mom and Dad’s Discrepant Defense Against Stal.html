I’m still not sure what a “cult” movie is, pre­cise­ly, but I can’t imag­ine what sort of cult could pos­si­bly sus­tain itself around the ethos of this film alone, despite its con­cise, agi­tat­ing, at once light­heart­ed, yet gen­uine­ly-dis­turb­ing trip. No, it is prob­a­bly not pro­pa­gan­da. From the experts, you’ll get <em>pre­cise­ly</em> the same review, vary­ing only in length. <em>The New York Times</em>’ Glenn Ken­ny <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/mom-and-dad-review-nicolas-cage.html" shape="rect" target="_blank">couldn’t be both­ered</a> with more than 250 words, but RogerE­bert dot com’s Simon Abrams <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mom-and-dad-2018" shape="rect" target="_blank">shelled out a whole 1000</a>. They are sus­pi­cious­ly close to these big round num­bers - per­haps each was writ­ten to respec­tive quo­tas, and per­haps you could say all that could rea­son­ably be said in 10, but I don’t care.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>The tropes here are pol­ished to a mirac­u­lous sheen - two emo­tion­al­ly-stunt­ed, mid­dleaged, over­ly pre­oc­cu­pied-with-their-lost-youth sub­ur­ban par­ents (Nico­las Cage and Sel­ma Blair) who’s exist­ing envies &amp; irri­ta­tions regard­ing their own clas­si­cal­ly brat­ty teenage girl (Anne Win­ters) and her mis­chie­vous lit­tle broth­er (Zackary Arthur) is mere­ly agi­tat­ed by a sud­den TV sta­t­ic-bound killer instinct into blood­lust, not orig­i­nat­ed. I’m not sure any pill deal­er would actu­al­ly flip off their cus­tomers after a fair buy - even in high school, but <em>drugs</em>, a <em>black boyfriend</em>, and a <em>stinkbomb</em>? in the old Trans Am!? <em>I’m going to kill you!</em></div><div><em><br clear="none"/></em></div><div>Some­body, some­where knew all the best sources on sub­ur­bia and how to put them to good use. The Cam­ry, the golf bag, ping pong smash­ing, sweat-stained Big Sur tee, and <em>Dr. Oz</em>, for Christ’s sake! Grant­ed, talk­ing to your girlfriend/boyfriend on the phone at all is a bit dat­ed - espe­cial­ly while rid­ing a BMX - and I don’t think Froot Loops are gen­er­al­ly accept­ed mid­dle-class chow any­more. These are sta­ples from <em>my</em> youth, and I am very old. Tech­ni­cal­ly, the iMes­sage bub­ble graph­ics are more chrono­graph­i­cal­ly appro­pri­ate, but with great con­se­quence, I fear - if we’re going to accept them once and for all as authen­tic mech­a­nisms for telling sto­ries set in the present, they are going to age faster than Nick’s new jowls (unless we’re all soon killed by our par­ents.) It’s been two years since I knew any­thing about music, but I seri­ous­ly doubt even the gothest fifteen?-year-old girls are lis­ten­ing to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/billsaberdotcom/iknowupussiesdontwantit" shape="rect" target="_blank">Father-esque post-Mem­phis hor­ror­core</a> in class - there’s some­thing about Sound­Cloud that real­ly clash­es with chok­ers.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>If there was ever a film in which to use grimy dub­step-influ­enced elec­tron­ic slaps, buzzes, chirps, and great grat­ing clank­ing, it’s this one. It’s a ter­rif­ic dis­ap­point­ment that Hol­ly­wood feels so timid­ly about their use of the most inti­mate medi­um. One for­gets its poten­tial to con­trol the nuances of an audience’s fear, anger, dis­com­fort, and pan­ic beyond cheap jump scares until they expe­ri­ence an irri­tat­ing, dis­tress­ing, ghast­ly gross, all-pos­sess­ing feat of accen­tu­at­ing audio pro­duc­tion such as that of <em>Mom and Dad</em>. If you want to judge Aca­d­e­m­i­cal­ly the <em>effec­tive­ness </em>of a nominee’s work for an award with a title like Best Sound Edit­ing (as opposed to what­ev­er the hell cri­te­ria was met most ful­ly by <em>Sky­fall</em>,) you <em>must</em> give the lit­tle gold­en man to these folks, who­ev­er they are.</div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><img src="Mom and Dad’s Discrepant Defense Against Stal_files/Image.png" type="image/png" data-filename="Image.png" height="251" width="576"/></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>When’s the last time you saw a tru­ly, believ­ably shit­ty mod­ern parental pair on a big screen? I real­ly can’t remem­ber, myself. Brent and Kendall Ryan are mas­ter­pieces of char­ac­ter craft - both a per­fect pré­cis <em>and </em>thor­ough­ly-defined explo­ration of mis­er­able white sub­ur­ban­ites. They’re even <em>named</em> unim­prov­ably, which reflects a qual­i­ty in care and atten­tion to detail that I very much appre­ci­ate. They are vain, vul­gar, impa­tient, self­ish­ly afraid, and care­less, freely feel­ing and say­ing it all direct­ly in front of their chil­dren. I love being told explic­it­ly which char­ac­ters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it’s the whole damned lot. Bri­an Tay­lor and Nico­las Cage <a href="https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc" shape="rect" target="_blank">scream</a> it over and over (as I’d like to imag­ine) a sin­gle after­noon of one-take film­ing, con­sid­er­ing that the lat­ter took it upon him­self to first <a href="http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/" shape="rect" target="_blank">mem­o­rize the entire screen­play</a> and its prose, vanil­la to per­fec­tion, before pho­tog­ra­phy began, and I hope it all stays with him for­ev­er, espe­cial­ly “my mom is such a penis.”</div><div><em>Mom and Dad</em> could con­ceiv­ably be Nico­las Cage’s <em>I Am Leg­end </em>if for no oth­er rea­son than the total lack of pos­si­ble stand-ins for Brent Ryan - even the stan­dard by which all white sub­ur­ban Dad per­for­mances have been mea­sured in the 21st cen­tu­ry, Jason Bate­man. Nick him­self <a href="http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/" shape="rect" target="_blank">described </a>it as “punk rock, rebel­lious, irrev­er­ent, orig­i­nal, badass,” and the “num­ber one” movie he’s made in the past ten years (dis­qual­i­fy­ing <em>Nation­al Trea­sure</em>, in case you were wor­ried.) No sur­prise, I must agree - this one is a won­der­ful­ly rau­cous and fer­al thing, but the scene involv­ing the attempt­ed mur­der of a new­born by her moth­er (Kendall’s sis­ter) came very close to cross­ing the line. How­ev­er, I am old and the inten­si­ty of my pater­nal instincts has prob­a­bly out­paced my under­stand­ing of them. You could also argue, of course, that push­ing such bound­aries is a core func­tion of a film like <em>Mom and Dad. </em>Nobody end­ed up vom­it­ing or any­thing.</div><div>This <em>fun </em>thing shouldn’t feel as for­eign as it does in cin­e­ma, but you already knew that. With all its implic­it grap­ples with over­pop­u­la­tion, kids and gun vio­lence, class, and racism - tru­ly, this is a film charged elec­tri­cal­ly with cur­rent issues. Or maybe not. Ulti­mate­ly, I can at least tell you for cer­tain that Bri­an Tay­lor made expo­nen­tial­ly bet­ter use of his resources (I couldn’t find a sol­id num­ber for its pro­duc­tion bud­get) than the Fuck­ing Spierig Broth­ers did with <em>Win­ches­ter </em>(just so you know what a dis­as­ter looks like,) and man­aged to be refresh­ing­ly orig­i­nal (aston­ish­ing that nobody’s had this spe­cif­ic idea before.) A spec­tac­u­lar riot, <em>Mom and Dad </em>does all you could pos­si­bly want it to do. With just eighty-three min­utes to lose, it’s worth the com­mit­ment just to hear Nico­las Cage whim­per and say “anal beads.”</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br clear="none"/></div></span>
