<span><div>-&quot;Family&quot; might be a better word</div><div>-surprised that I maintained perspective throughout the whole thing and didn't break down... until PEB and James said goodbye.</div><div><br/></div><div>-Where do I see myself next year? Leaving these good people alone - we're <i>Milky Holmes </i>cosplaying to an antique tractor pull, or something. A higher-value endeavor in culture shock. Or, I could just stay with my musician friends and do my best to move my feet like a sub-Chicagoan idiot for three straight days.</div><div><br/></div><div>-The few furries I interacted with were nothing but civil, friendly, and good-humored, and their costumes were <i>not </i>the sun-faded, ill-fitting Sorrow Suits I'd seen from Shame Twitter. In fact, there were some that were downrite masterful. I didn't see a single one that did not bring their Flex, and that is deeply-respectable. </div><div><br/></div><div>-Distinctly less sexually-unsettling than fucking Warped Tour. the only unwanted sexual attention came from a 30-something mathematics professor in a cheap safari outfit who attempted to conceal his advances toward Emily by blanketing the whole lot of us with his stale breath.</div><div><br/></div><div>The research I'd done to prepare didn't stray much from the organization-provided <a href="http://magfest.org/about/">resources</a> on the Fest's website. Justin first suggested we attend in November, I think, from whence the necessity of our attendance grew ever greater with the expected turnout of friends.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Friends</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>The word lacks the strength to carry the significance, really.</div><div><br/></div><div>According to my profile, I created my Twitter account in June, 2009, at 15, and I've looked at the service at least once for 90% of the 2800 days, since. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the <i>only</i> other life element I've retained so completely is my piano habit. Consistency is absolutely alien to me, for better or worse. I'm telling you this for perspective's sake - I am <i>very</i> socially-dependent on Twitter, and have been for my entire adult life. I've used it to osmose into infinitely many networks, in some way, as my interests, voice, and brain cells have changed. In high school, when diversity of thought and experiences are the most essential in forming one's identity, I found a relative lack of both in College Town, Midwest. In the immediate, at least.</div><div><br/></div><div>Through a <i>very</i> tiny group of school friends, I became acquainted with a first few persons, most of whom I cannot recall. All were identified by display names except for myself, of course. Most were unified by their interest in anime, but I'd never seen a bit of it. Three of the earliest names I can remember: PhoneEatingBear, Mowtendoo, and James Wilson. All of whom I was able to meet at the Gaylord (though I didn't recognize Mowtendoo at first, and missed my opportunity to converse.)</div><div><br/></div><div>I've interacted with PEB and James weekly for 6+ years, and I got to hug them in person for the first time. (I almost set PEB on fire... at least it's memorable.)</div><div><br/></div><div>I don't know what it means, really, but I know it's significant. I wasn't surprised to learn that a great many of us were making similarly-tardy contact. Some were nervous, and I expected to be, but I felt nothing but elation on our first thirty-minute commute <a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr"></a><a dir="ltr">on Friday afternoon</a>. 100% <i>sober</i> elation, too, which has been all but non-existent in my emotional spectrum for years. We passed the NSA Headquarters exit, which was unexpected and amusing. Though everybody else (for the most part) had literally crafted macros to score Gaylord rooms months in advance, our Red Roof exile ended up proving fruitful in twice treating us to the cozy majesty of the Potomac's bedding, opening before us as we emerged from the hills on I-95.</div><div><br/></div><div>The condensed spectacle we were subjected to makes it difficult to remember much detail. The little waterfront city is really just a gradually-descending moat to its Gargantuan Gay Monolith, and the whole scene is framed in my memory - with vague mirages of heavy industry in the distance - in a near-apocalyptic light. Not that it was distressing in any way. The practiced accommodation of the staff culture was absolutely unbelievable, and as I passed the ornamental HENTAI Aston parked in the six-lane circle drive in front of its astonishingly-inbewildered five star hotel doorman tipping his peaked cap at an arriving gaggle of no-BS <i>Fire Emblem</i> cosplayers, the contrast began to resolve itself through one not-so-perplexing realization: <b>nerds have money, now</b>.</div><div><br/></div><div>What assumptions I'd brought with me lent toward a high probability of catching a maid hysterically sprinting and screaming from a shrugging, shit-smeared furry in his doorway, or something. And yeah, I heard a few stories on the floor, but the professionalism of our hosts and discouraging, through-and-through decency of our fellow festgoers prevented the event from developing even <i>the slightest tension</i> of a filthy, perverse occupation.</div><div><br/></div><div>If I'm honest, some juvenile edginess deep within me had counted on the conflict.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wanted to correspond from an all-out cultural <i>war</i>, like a <i>real reporter</i>, but my hunger for camaraderie in the fantastical &amp; shocking upheaval of all moralist power (read: a good party) would remain unrequited, though I found enough in our repeated, cacophonous assaults on &quot;The Soap Box&quot; (the free-for-all TEDx room, if you will,) to satiate my more prehistoric frustrations. (These are the singular elements I actually managed to account onsite in my Day One &amp; Day Two entries.)</div><div><br/></div><div>Once again, I had misjudged culture and counter-culture's timeless dance and wound up - crowdsourced - in the well-mannered playground of 25,000 <i>reasonable people</i>...</div><div><br/></div><div>But I was <i>there</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don't play video games or make music, really, but I had to do <i>something.</i></div><div><i><br/></i></div><div>I didn't bring a single milligram of adderall with me to the East - mostly because of procrastination on health insurance details, but in part because I wanted to use the opportunity to prove to myself that I could still at least maintain the minimums of human function without it in such a setting. I think I'm glad I didn't, actually. I doubt I would've been able to absorb the atmosphere as passively as I did. Too much more exuberance, and I very well could have done something worthy of kicking me out.</div><div><br/></div><div>Criminality proved exceedingly challenging.</div><div><br/></div><div>Somehow, every single one of the fuckers was in on some joke... some reference to a legendary Poking Man who's party trick is a protracted vocal emission of extreme agitation - from belly-bellow to banshee-howl in a linear upswing. </div><div><br/></div><div>When in a sans-amphetamine, intellectually-compromised state, screaming has long been my go-to for a quick and easy punking. But in this place... this billion-dollar luxury labyrinth... my screams were no nuisance at all, but instead a horrid siren call to the trachea behind a thousand foul neckbeards, <i>regardless of the hour!</i></div><div><br/></div><div>And with the effectiveness of my once-dependable core lunacy utterly nullified, I found myself hopelessly-equipped against the earnestness of this... oppressing, sincere, and enthusiastic species.</div><div><a href="United with Family in the Abysmal Serenity of_files/Evernote 20170130 013830.m4a"><img src="United with Family in the Abysmal Serenity of_files/f8fcaeead734baec537d22d3e589877e.png" alt="Evernote 20170130 013830.m4a"></a></div><div><a href="United with Family in the Abysmal Serenity of_files/Evernote 20170130 020417.m4a"><img src="United with Family in the Abysmal Serenity of_files/0f3c31df0de59aa9b4de38dba6e23ed9.png" alt="Evernote 20170130 020417.m4a"></a><br/></div><div><br/></div></span>
