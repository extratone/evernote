-THE BIG FIRST DRIVE of the icon - E36 M3 - was actually quite disappointing because all I could think of was &quot;wow this car is amazing and I'll never be able to really experience it because I'll either be arrested or constantly afraid of being arrested.&quot;
<div><br/></div><div>-Won't be able to continue this blog because I've died in a car accident, sorry.</div><div><br/></div><div>-Today, my friend brought his M3 back to town. I called him up, took the keys, and battered his car for several hours - then ate only crab rangoon at a Chinese restaurant and chugged Monster - and then battered his car some more until I eventually ended up wrapping the car around a pole. Nothing left now but ashes, the frame, and my charred remains.</div><div><br/></div><div>-I had a headache before I drank the Monster - it was really getting bad as I thrashed that M3 around corners with my terrified friend in the passenger's seat. It's gone now - all pain has faded away into the void.</div><div><br/></div><div>-Forced down the Monster, snacked on the jerky sticks, and worked on my best &quot;M3 trying to attract girls&quot; face, which it turns out, is almost completely identical to my &quot;I'm in absolute agony right now&quot; face.</div><div><br/></div><div>-I see him now, observing the damage I have done to the sidewalk and his dreams, and for the first time, I can hear his thoughts. He deeply regrets our friendship.</div><div><br/></div><div>-And though Edward Loh saved MotorTrend from certain #AutoGate, I see him fill his column with safety acronyms, and he's not even jesting. </div><div><br/></div><div>-I sit and my basement and people have no idea that I actually conceptualized adaptive cruise control in 2001 at age 7, after watching a family explorer sacrifice health and home to maintain the rigid speed demanded of it. I even proposed the use of radar. And I'd never heard of it before. Not lying.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>-&quot;I have a theory about all drivers.  Safety has been so overemphasized that fun and enjoyment have been completely eliminated.  Driving is treated as a bother, a chore, something to just get done so it's over with.  If it's not worth all of your attention, why would you give it? </div><div>And now, not only is driving boring and dangerous, it's practically a sin.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>-&quot;What is consent?&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>-&quot;This is an M3.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>-&quot;This is a good car.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>See &quot;make fun, make safe&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>-I don't need sources or real statistics in my own blog, you huge cunts.</div><div><br/></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br/></div><div>Today, I drove an E36 M3. <i>The</i> M3. The Icon...The One...The Good One...The Good Coupe...The Good Sedan...The Fast Car...The Fastest Car...Not The Fastest Car...The Highest Value Performance Car...The Everyday Supercar...The Bavarian Blacktop Bishop.</div><div><br/></div><div>The M3.</div><div><br/></div><div>All that money spent pretending to read Autoweek, all those Forza miles - they've finally paid off. I have gripped the wheel of one of my all time heroes. Turned it, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>Today, all of my high school dreams were realized.</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;I'm gonna get an M3 some day.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>Are you sure it's that good?</div><div><br/>
Can it really be <i>that</i> good?</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;Get an M3.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;It's good.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>Is it good? Is the best? What is it like to drive an M3?</div><div><br/></div><div>________________________________________________</div><div><br/></div><div>A good friend of mine had been looking to buy an M3 for a long while. He'd finally found a good example nearby - <font color="#FBCD5F">cosmos black</font>, caramel interior, 120,000 miles. It was today that he settled on a deal and drove the car home. This placed a gigantic responsibility on my shoulders. The M3 is an icon. It's The Big One. I am the auto media guy. I had no choice. I found him, took the keys by force, and set off with an intent to wreak havoc - friend riding along in the passenger's seat.</div><div><br/></div><div>First, I have to refuel. We visit a small Chinese restaurant with a huge variety of authentic dishes and I eat only crab rangoon. Straight from there to buy a can of Monster energy drink. I'm fully committed to living The M Way. </div><div><br/></div><div>My mind has become a mess of fog.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>What does &quot;consent&quot; mean?</i></div><div><br/></div><div>My friend tries desperately to explain, but the memory of the word and all its synonyms have been blocked. I no longer have the ability to understand the idea.</div><div><br/></div><div>Bare knuckles, bare chest. I am a youth. It is time to be a youth for once. It is time to &quot;bruise up some tires&quot; and &quot;hoon.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>I'm shaking as the Monster works its way through my system, dialing away all self-awareness. Think of the most unsophisticated, agricultural clutch you've ever used - the M3's is not that.</div><div><br/></div><div>I struggle with the driver's side window. The car has decided I have only a few optional heights between wide-open and closed, just as it has decided the temperature in the cabin will be 16 degrees C. I don't know how anything works. It is best to let the car decide.</div><div><br/></div><div>Engine's really spooling now. I've primed its precious straight-six slickness. Drum and bass engulfs the entire area and I'm bleeding certainty and inhibition all over the leather. 200...300 instances of the same break playing out of sync.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Sechzehn Grad!</i></div><div><br/></div><div>The car knows I'm going to tell - I can feel it. It <i>knows.</i> What is it I'm going to say? I don't know but it's now certain the Germans will neutralize me first. It wants me to end it all.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Du müssen es jetzt tun!</i></div><div><i><br/></i></div><div>This is perfection and I'm going to smother it. I'm going to <i>punish</i> it for its life.</div><div><br/></div><div>Robin Williams is behind me screaming &quot;Give them the bird!&quot; over and over again, laughing...choking. I must harness my desire for death into ground-covering flight.</div><div><br/></div><div>I try again and again to upset its nationalism, to extract a hint of an approaching limit, but I feel nothing. The car grips the plebeian asphalt and can do naught but grip harder. My face pays the price.</div><div><br/></div><div>I'm going to be sick. We're going to fly off the road. Please give me an excuse. Please give me release.</div><div><br/></div><div>The M3 doesn't listen. It's too engrossed in solemn reflection on the Führer. This is das blitzkrieg, but we're not invading. We are trying to escape something that isn't chasing us. We are very late to no particular occasion.</div><div><br/></div><div>We were going to take the dog to the park, but he has succumbed to his injuries. I really hadn't planned on dying on a Monday. Everyone says they're very bad. This is not something the M3 understands. 120,000 miles and yet we must continue, faster and faster. <i>Arbeiten</i>. Yes, the good stuff. We have no patience for the lower classes. I have no home, no bed. There is only the road and the noise.</div><div><br/></div><div>I used to dote on BMW's instruments, but I absolutely despise the dials in front of me now. The tachometer's needle never stops moving in its perfectly round circuit. Nothing is <i>that</i> circular.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Nicht gut genug.</i></div><div><i><br/></i></div><div>I am not good enough. David Blue is not a racecar driver. I do not have a single lap time. I do not know the name of every corner on the Nürburgring. I am a young American man with one quarter of a liberal arts degree and this is the most iconic sports executive coupe ever built. We cannot be one.</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;This is an M3.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>All I can do is probe for the limit like surgery with a club. Push pedal more, turn wheel fast. Are we going to make it? Probably not.</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;Good car.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>With every approaching corner I enact incrementally greater suppression of my survival instincts. The car and I are now allies in a war against my senses. My mind's figures insist we cannot survive the angle that approaches at this speed. We force it to accelerate. We emerge safely on the other side without having witnessed a single discernible symptom of overdrawn traction. I am writing checks the M3 can cash quite easily. I am regretting not using more bank metaphors early on.</div><div><br/></div><div>For the first time, I feel like the idle shoppers and pedestrians that audibly scream at the speed I walk in public. I am just another pathetic being without the aptitude to understand movement in this realm of velocity. In this car, I am just another startled horsemom.</div><div><br/></div><div>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br/></div><div>The M3 is a good car. We've known this for 20 years. It's superb in nearly every way. But in the time I drove it, I wasn't thinking about how fun it was to pin apexes and accelerate out of bends, or to egg on the engine's wonderful noise. It should've been an exhilarating sensory indulgence, but instead, it was just saddening.</div><div><br/></div><div>All I could think about was the tremendous obstacles an M3 owner faces. The E36 has a higher limit than any car I've ever driven, and it's not all that high by modern performance coupe standards. In order to break anything loose, you must maintain two or three times the posted speed limit. And of course, you're immediately an outlaw if you do. Even at 3 in the morning on isolated country roads, you still have the law to worry about.</div><div><br/></div><div>To think that someone named Tracy in a first generation Plymouth Voyager that's managed to traverse 400,000 miles without so much as an alignment or oil change is held to the same road laws as this M3 is absolutely mind-boggling. It may seem petty if you've never driven anything performance-oriented, but the difference in plantedness is just so huge, it's a joke.</div><div><br/></div><div>All that beautifully engineered athleticism, and you're the enemy of the state. You cannot flex your machine's abilities in the daylight without sneers, honking, fines, and incarceration. Fail to hide away your joy and your skill, and you're bound to ruin many a miserable fleshbucket's &quot;Monday.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Yes, I can see that quick movement startles you, and that you become very easily upset from events that do not involve you. It's unfortunate that evolution was staved off and your creation allowed to commence. Unnecessary suffering is only a byproduct of the rotting collective intellect, and it's not your fault. I'd advise you to stay inside your home, and refrain from consuming food or water. Find a nice comfy place to lie down, and remain there until you die. It is the only humane correction to your species' blunder.</i></div><div><i><br/></i></div><div><i>It is 2014, yet you still cling to your ancient pack instincts without any self-examination. An M3 powerslides by you. It does not hit you. It does not kill you. It does not kill anyone you care about. It does not hurt you. It does not hurt anyone you care about. It does not collide with you. It does not move on a trajectory that would require you to alter your own to avoid a collision, yet you do so anyway because your mind fails you. </i></div><div><i><br/></i></div><div><i>You could have closed your eyes for a brief moment as it passed, and nothing would have been different in your life. And yet, you get very upset. You are part of the pack, and the M3's driver is a danger to the pack. You are a good, diligent pack member, and the M3's driver is not. He is taking action against the interest of the pack. Your genetic memory insists you must make aware! You must alert! You must note his license plate number and report him to pack enforcement!</i></div><div><i><br/></i></div><div><i>This human being is an idiot! Doesn't he know he could hurt a child?! Why isn't he doing his taxes?!</i></div><div><i><br/></i></div><div><i>Your face turns very red and your breath quickens. You are very ignorant.</i></div><div><br/></div><div>This being is the ultimate enemy of the M3 owner. And I'm not chiding with the commoner's &quot;omg people are so dumb&quot; argument, I really mean it. Ignorance is the ultimate crack in the foundation of driving utopia, and it infects all aspects of everything. Even the most intelligent the world has to offer fall prey to their shitty instincts, if left unconfronted. </div><div><br/></div><div>The obsession with safety continues. The technology that had been so boldly harnessed to launch ourselves over technical obstructions like weight and suspension technology is now manipulated to further the agenda of Safety Sally, with legislated crumple zones and save-your-sorry-ass electronannies. </div><div><br/></div><div>But I must make a proposal. First, something to think over: If driving is treated as a boring, dangerous, archaic chore - a necessary evil - why would you bother giving it your full attention? Could this not be why so many people end up dying behind the wheel?</div><div><br/></div><div>Now, here's a rare chance to impress my fellow youth without complete dishonesty.</div><div><br/></div><div>If this is how you feel about driving, why not take public transportation? If it's even an option in your mind, you're probably not bothered by the diseases or operating on the city's schedule or even making regular eye contact with the proletariat. You'd probably hate my alternatives even if they were plausible, and this is the system you have.</div><div><br/></div><div>Of course, coast to coast public transport in the US would be an undertaking of absurd proportions, but you should know by now that there are always alternatives to driving yourself. So, if it's really that bad, don't do it. Leave what's left of your roads to those of us that enjoy them, and go get a disease.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ultimately, the M3 feels incredibly fresh and alive, and that's why it's so out of place.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>These are some questions you may be asking. They may be good questions, but they are certainly  not good questions to be asking <i>me</i>. If you really want a review on a 20 year old car - go look it up, because I'm going to take this rare, revered experience, and use it only as clever context in my upcoming discussion (WARNING) about the most interesting topic on Earth: SAFETY.</div><div><br/></div><div>Safety is a big concern for drivers. People get hurt sometimes, then other people get very upset and write letters and hire lawyers and complain and shoot up schools, etc. There are tears, bills, jail time, bail, court fees, postage fees, plumbing fees, psychiatrist fees, late fees, and entrepreneurial fees.</div><div><br/></div><div>With the greatest threat to humankind being its own overabundance, each of you has now become absolutely obsessed with continuing your existence as long as scientifically possible, indifferent to its quality.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></span>
