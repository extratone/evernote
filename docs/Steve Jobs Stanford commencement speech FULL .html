  below is the full text of a commencement speech former Apple CEO
  Steve Jobs gave at Stanford University in 2005.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 1em 0px;">
  It's a well-known speech, and one of Jobs' most notable public
  appearances. It's a short speech, but it still highlights Jobs'
  considerable strengths as a storyteller and inspirational leader.

  Read the speech: 
</h2>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one
  of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from
  college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a
  college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from
  my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  The first story is about connecting the dots.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then
  stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I
  really quit. So why did I drop out?
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young,
  unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for
  adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by
  college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted
  at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out
  they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
  So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the
  middle of the night asking: &quot;We have an unexpected baby boy; do
  you want him?&quot; They said: &quot;Of course.&quot; My biological mother later
  found out that my mother had never graduated from college and
  that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused
  to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months
  later when my parents promised that I would someday go to
  college.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a
  college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my
  working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college
  tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had
  no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college
  was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all
  of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided
  to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was
  pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best
  decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop
  taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin
  dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on
  the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢
  deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across
  town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare
  Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by
  following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless
  later on. Let me give you one example:
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy
  instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster,
  every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed.
  Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal
  classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do
  this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about
  varying the amount of space between different letter
  combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was
  beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science
  can't capture, and I found it fascinating.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my
  life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first
  Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it
  all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful
  typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in
  college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or
  proportionally spaced fonts. And since<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/windows" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0, 112, 154); border-color: rgb(0, 112, 154);">Windows</a> just copied the Mac, it's likely that
  no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out,
  I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and
  personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that
  they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking
  forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear
  looking backwards ten years later.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only
  connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the
  dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in
  something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This
  approach has never let me down, and it has made all the
  difference in my life.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  My second story is about love and loss.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I
  started <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/apple" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0, 112, 154); border-color: rgb(0, 112, 154);">Apple</a> in my parents garage when I was 20.
  We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two
  of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000
  employees. We had just released our finest creation - the
  Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I
  got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started?
  Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very
  talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so
  things went well. But then our visions of the future began to
  diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our
  Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very
  publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was
  gone, and it was devastating.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I
  had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I
  had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with
  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/david-packard" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0, 112, 154); border-color: rgb(0, 112, 154);">David Packard</a> and Bob Noyce and tried to
  apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure,
  and I even thought about running away from the valley. But
  something slowly began to dawn on me - I still loved what I did.
  The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had
  been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start
  over.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from
  Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The
  heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of
  being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me
  to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  During the next five years, I started a company named <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/next" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0, 112, 154); border-color: rgb(0, 112, 154);">NeXT</a>, another company named <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/pixar" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0, 112, 154); border-color: rgb(0, 112, 154);">Pixar</a>, and fell in love with an amazing woman
  who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds
  first computer animated feature film, <em>Toy Story</em>, and is
  now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a
  remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to
  Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of
  Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful
  family together.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been
  fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the
  patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a
  brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that
  kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find
  what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for
  your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your
  life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you
  believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to
  love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.
  Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when
  you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets
  better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you
  find it. Don't settle.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  My third story is about death.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: &quot;If you
  live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most
  certainly be right.&quot; It made an impression on me, and since then,
  for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning
  and asked myself: &quot;If today were the last day of my life, would I
  want to do what I am about to do today?&quot; And whenever the answer
  has been &quot;No&quot; for too many days in a row, I know I need to change
  something.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool
  I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
  Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride,
  all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall
  away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
  Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to
  avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are
  already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at
  7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my
  pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors
  told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is
  incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three
  to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs
  in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to
  try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next
  10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure
  everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible
  for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

  I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a
  biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my
  stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and
  got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who
  was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a
  microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be
  a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with
  surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now.

  This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's
  the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through
  it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when
  death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

  No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't
  want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all
  share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,
  because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.
  It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for
  the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from
  now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry
  to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

  Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's
  life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the
  results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of
  others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most
  important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
  They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
  Everything else is secondary.

  When I was young, there was an amazing publication called <em>The
  Whole Earth Catalog</em>, which was one of the bibles of my
  generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not
  far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his
  poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal
  computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with
  typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like

  Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat
  tools and great notions.

<blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding-left: 30px;">
  Stewart and his team put out several issues of <em>The Whole
  Earth Catalog</em>, and then when it had run its course, they put
  out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On
  the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early
  morning country road, the kind you might find yourself
  hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the
  words: &quot;Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.&quot; It was their farewell message
  as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always
  wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I
  wish that for you.
