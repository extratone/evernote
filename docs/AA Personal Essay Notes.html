(at least in my view.)</div><div><br/></div><div>-I distinctly remember a hard-to-describe feeling/atmosphere that Dad, and in some cases the family created.  The closest I can come to describing it is a 50s rural farm mentality.  I always felt that I was essentially useless.  It seemed to me that other farm kids were more resilient and always knew what needed to be done.  I think, possibly because of the ADD (which dad would not let me be examined for.  Possibly because he was uncomfortable with acknowledging his own mental problems) I was always spacing out when working with Dad, so i wouldn't know what to do, which would frustrate him.</div><div><br/></div><div>-Although it may not be particularly relevant, thinking back now, I realize that the duality of my life left me feeling like an outcast on both sides.  On the farm and around farmers, I felt like a &quot;city kid,&quot; and I remember (perhaps incorrectly, perhaps not,) Dad speaking about this a few times, maybe even using that terminology.  At school, I felt like I didn't understand the other kids.  Which is somewhat true.  Many things that most kids experienced throughout their childhood, I was not aware of or exposed to.  Video games, T.V. shows, movies, food, etc.  </div><div><br/></div><div>-I could consider this a good thing though because there will come a point where not experiencing such things will be irrelevant, and I spent the time that would've taken on doing things I would consider beneficial and productive.  (Mechanical stuff, reading, working, selling sweetcorn, etc..)</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Important/Specific Imagery</b></div><div><u style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></u></div><div><u style="font-weight: bold;">Smells:</u> </div><div>-Coffee (with a ton of creamer) </div><div>-Diesel Fuel</div><div>-Gasoline?</div><div>-WD-40</div><div>-Rat shit</div><div><br/></div><div><b><u>Sounds:</u></b></div><div>-Oldies music on the radio.</div><div><b><u><br/></u></b></div><div><b><u>Images/Visual Memories:</u></b></div><div>-Use the imagery of hot and cold to compare the different feelings of both &quot;lives.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div><font color="#E30000"><b><u>I CHANGED THESIS HERE</u></b></font></div><div><b><font color="#E30000"><u><br/></u></font></b></div><div>After talking to Ms. Obregon</div><div><br/></div><ul><li>-A focus on imagery; showing more than telling.</li><li>-With the above, I decided to write to a different prompt.</li><li>-New focus is on the specific event that ended going out to dad's.

-I remember walking fairly far behind dad toward the jewelry store, away from the food court.  I was nervous, as I always was when we were in public with his bad mood, because others did not understand, which would sometimes lead to quarrels. <br/><div><div><br/></div><ul><li>Dropping me off</li></ul>
-After the mall, Dad drove to mom's house without explaining why (which was disconcerting and unusual.)</div><div>-When we arrived in front of the house, dad told me that he would not be picking me up for awhile.  </div><div>-I acted disappointed, and I believe that it was fairly convincing.</div><div>-I paused deliberately before getting out of the Explorer, making every effort to act as if I didn't want to leave, yet inside, I was so excited that it seemed I'd go blind.</div><div><br/></div><div><b><u>What this event changed:</u></b></div><ul><li>Freed me to have my own...</li></ul>

-Before, my true feelings were never on the surface, I always acted how I interpreted everyone wanted me to act.
