As awful as it is, I actually said &quot;<i>Extratone</i> <b>is</b> me,&quot; recently, and I wasn't being dishonest.</div><div><br/></div><div>I know that nobody reads these, but I shall continue to write them as if they are a life-and-death necessity. As I've said on nearly every one of our podcasts available, I will continue as if we have big readership <i>even if an audience never, ever comes.</i> Redundant, yeah, but... I've apparently yet to adequately clarify. And that's my particular compulsion, you know. Rarely, if ever, would I expect you to refrain from discouraging/disparaging my output - especially if the process yields good content - but I can't help but wonder if you'd rather spend your energy in a pursuit with <i>any</i> chance of influence? I suppose you don't trust me yet, and that's okay.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>This one is big. Somehow, there are <i>milestones</i> now, and they - quite suddenly - feel very intimate.</div><div><br/></div><div>I have been doing my best to come to terms with the word &quot;blogging&quot; as that's... what... I'm... doing...?</div><div><br/></div><div>We passed 100 total posts just last week, which seems a desperately small number when I consider that I have now - without doubt - expended more time and energy shipping a God Damned WordPress website than I ever have into any other one thing. (89 οf them are mine.)</div><div>[Glaring without any reasonable justification emoji.]</div><div>How's THAT for an admission?!</div><div><br/></div><div>I don't think I fully realized the extent of my emotional involvement until my friend Ammnontet - out of the blue - complimented the site. <a href="https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/774662833636188160">https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/774662833636188160</a></div><div>I know him well enough to respect his opinion and was therefore very highly complimented. Maybe even <i>stirred</i>? This viscous soul?!</div><div><br/></div><div>Turns out, he's got some great content up his sleeve. <i>Digital Noosphere</i> is born tomorrow. </div><div><br/></div><div><b>Audio</b></div><div>Episode 6 of <i>The New</i> [LINK] was by far the most acceptable yet. The youths were unusually well-behaved and therefore able to pass their unique insight much more easily.</div><div><br/></div><div>If you're interested in <i>Eve Online</i>, one of my longtime favorite hosts joined me for a conversation on the game's peculiar relevance, which - naturally - widened subjects a bit, though not exceeding &quot;existence,&quot; thankfully.</div><div><br/></div><div>For those of you that enjoy our particular rowdiness, <i>Off The Grid</i> has been extracted and given its own iTunes-spiffed RSS feed, meaning there are now four <i>Extratone</i> &quot;podcasts&quot; to choose from on That Unholy Aggregator which is still the best way to consume them??</div><div><br/></div><ul><li><i>Studio Eat -</i> <font face="Helvetica Neue" style="font-size: 12pt;">Studio Eat by Extratone</font></li><li><a href="https://itun.es/us/MA_Icb.c"><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica Neue" style="font-size: 12pt;">https://itun.es/us/MA_Icb.c</font></a>All audio content will continue to be sent here. Yes, that means there will be duplicates from the other feeds. The goal: appease diverse listener habits as completely as possible.

I've been considering the name <i>Futureland</i>, instead. This Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AsphaltApostle/status/774387649263996928">poll</a> - though sparse - says I should not. What do you think?</li><li><font face="Helvetica Neue" style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>Off The Grid by Extratone</i></font></li><li><a href="https://itun.es/us/grcTeb.c"><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica Neue" style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>https://itun.es/us/grcTeb.c</i></font></a><i>Off The Grid</i> - Obviously, the youngins needed a place to exhale their plentiful bitterness.

We're talking real amateur stuff here, so expected interest is negligible. </div><div><br/></div><div><b>Editorially</b></div><div>The Drywall website (and a good quantity of my other general content) was full of dishonesty for the sake of my entertainment, which wasn't inappropriate or dishonest in itself, I think, because it was never portrayed as truth. Though I am still amused by unscrupulousness and big claims, I no longer find it to be a major value in my work, which is why I recompiled my online presence, here. (It's probably what's preventing me from being actually funny these days, as well.)</div><div><br/></div><div>Instead of &quot;humor,&quot; I chose to categorize comedic content as Spectacle because it's more accurate in encompassing the value in content like <i>The Third Brain</i> or <i>Info Wars II</i>. As I said last month, it is published not out of malice, but of a very reverent respect for you - the audience - and your ability to independently differentiate your consumption. I know you are able, which is why I find warnings like &quot;comedy&quot; to be kinda patronizing, actually.</div><div><br/></div><div>In both the literal and literary sense - hopefully - <b>Perspective</b> (category) has been created. Though not necessary for a &quot;blog,&quot; explicitly labeling opinion is at least whispered by our magazine influence.</div><div><br/></div><div>For myself, the practice of steering the editorial direction of a publication as Captain is perhaps <i>Extratone</i>'s most intriguing function. I've just recently realized that in matters of sensitivity, I have a heavy bias toward factual exposure, so Kaleb's <a href="http://extratone.com/words/awoken/">critical analysis of truth</a> last week was very significant for me. It provided a cheque on my biggest blind spot, which is hugely reassuring.</div><div><br/></div><div>There are three words in the website's header. One is our name. The other two are <i>Rediscovering Relevance</i>, and they were not placed there in afterthought, nor whimsical procrastination. Though it is nice to have a pretty place for my own work, I created <i>Extratone</i> to <i>discuss,</i> making personally-alien arguments vastly more valuable than mirrored ones. If you're interested in content submission as a favor - which is not the optimal primary motivation in the least, but appears to be a popular one - do not be afraid of contentiousness. Even contentiousness for contentiousness' sake is worth consideration in <i>Extratone</i>'s growth as it stands, currently.</div><div><br/></div><div>On that note, Chet Munch has officially returned for good. No, really, it's not an alias for myself any longer. It <i>is</i> an alias, though, and the man himself is a well of abundant opinions. Distinctly, he holds them all in tremendous passion, which - in opposition to my inescapable stoicism - is genuinely precious. His newly-titled blog, <i><a href="http://www.extratone.com/muncher/">The Muncher</a></i> is our only avenue of ideological fervor to date, which has provided an interesting editorial conundrum. Generally, when &quot;editor&quot; is in a staffer's job title, his/her words must be acknowledged as representation of a publication's editorial bearing, unless otherwise stated. While I will accept political and ideological rhetoric, most of it is not within our relevance, frankly. I know Mr. Munch has words on a few relevant topics, though.</div><div><br/></div><div>Graciously, he has provided <i>Extratone</i> with its first topical alignment: <b>circumcision is a bizarre and archaic ritual</b> that is - by tremendous contradiction - still exceedingly practiced in our society. More than that, it is <b>violent genital mutilation</b> committed every day on humanity's objectively least-powerful age demographic, yet is hardly ever covered by <i>any</i> media. Therefore - by its <b>age</b> and conventional <b>obscurity</b>, it is in accord with our <a href="http://www.extratone.com/about/">stated function</a> <i>as it stands</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>This sort of activism will <i>not</i> be common, and our Alacrity Editor is not in agreement, but it <i>is</i> a substantial milestone.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Mechanically</b></div><div>I've gotten to the point of unconsciously loading the website in private browser tabs - on both desktop and iOS - with obscene frequency throughout my days; roaming around, trying to break stuff. I still regularly find &quot;no-brainer&quot; polish issues (e.g. redundant metadata in category pages' post displays.)</div><div><br/></div><div>Learning the scope of <i>fiddling</i> possibilities - especially considering the majority will never exist above readers' conscious threshold - has been truly fascinating. It's heartening, of course, to have derived a pursuit in which I will never reach satisfaction; I'll never be content enough to cease. We are not Tumblr, that's for sure.</div><div><br/></div><ul><li>I am <i>so</i> thrilled to be writing you in Garamond, my (and many others, admittedly) favorite serif typeface by a huge gap.</li><li>Funny enough, headers are wearing Baskerville - the next one down. Serif headers are a bit of risk, but I like it a lot. What'll stay is still in contention - leave your thoughts in a comment if you have them.</li><li>All navigation font has been changed to Playfair Display, meaning not a single same character remains on this beautiful child.</li><li>Categories and their snippets have been reworked with images and Sheffer strokes (this thing -&gt; |) in place of hyphens. This will be applied manually to individual post snippets, as well.</li><li>&quot;Related Posts&quot; are now determined by like-category <i>or</i> like-tag. Sorry about that oversight.</li><li>The header mega-menus &quot;audio&quot; and &quot;visuals&quot; now display links to their subcategories left of their encompassed posts.</li><li>Apple News is on hold until the Publish to Apple News plugin is fixed.</li></ul><div><br/></div><div>The most significant change in appearance, though, is the addition of the &quot;reading time&quot; meta note on posts in our main page's featured content slider and at the top of each individual post. While I think it's intelligent and useful, it's awfully-<i>bloggish</i>. Not as vulgar as a &quot;views&quot; mark, at least.</div><div><br/></div></span>
