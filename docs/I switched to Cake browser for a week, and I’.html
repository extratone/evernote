<p><span>The one thing you should know about me is that my curiosity levels soar high, almost at all times. And for the same reason, I often find myself <a href="https://the8-bit.com/these-are-the-major-selling-points-of-the-iphone-x/"><span>glued to my iPhone</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>When computers were considered to be the latest trend in technology, there wasn’t much portability in its <a href="https://the8-bit.com/top-10-unique-android-applications/"><span>applications</span></a>. Whenever you’d want to get insights on a topic, or simply send an email, you’d have to wait to get home to access that monstrous box with a screen which then, apparently overwhelmed you with information.</span></p>
<p><span>But, thankfully, progress has led us to an era where a significant part of our life now is dependent on smartphones. To sum it all up in high-school syllabus terms, smartphones are something which has made the process of acquiring information much easier, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span>As for me, I <a href="https://the8-bit.com/chrome-vs-firefox-vs-safari-vs-edge-which-is-the-best-browser-for-an-iphone/"><span>used to use Safari</span></a> to access the web when I wasn’t near a laptop or a desktop. It’s fluid, simple, minimalistic; and the most important thing is it gets the job done, every time. It’s also probably one of the most secure browsers out there. But, after some time using the famed browser from Apple, I got bored. Have you ever felt UI sickness? I’ve coined that term for myself meaning getting bored/sick of using the same UI every day. Yeah, I felt that using Safari. Things got way too minimalistic.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, I shifted my focus to Google’s Chrome browser for iOS. Albeit, I got tired of that as well. Further, I tried Mozilla. It had this heaviness that repelled me away from it. Not to mention other browsers, I had tried everything to make myself more interactive towards my research. I wanted to make collecting information fun, fast, and interesting for myself. And neither of the mainstream browsers available for the platform (iOS) managed to get even close.</span></p>
<p><span>Later, upon contemplating the reasons for the loss of my interest in research, I realized that it wasn’t the browsers that inhibited my concerns; it was the way the browsing methods were laid on in the first place. But, eventually, in my conquest for finding a better browsing option, I found Cake.</span></p>
<p><span>Cake, in this case, is not something you devour by melting it in your saliva. It is a full-fledged browser which revolutionizes the way you browse. So far, we have experienced <a href="https://the8-bit.com/chrome-vs-firefox-vs-safari-vs-edge-which-is-the-best-browser-for-an-iphone/"><span>mobile browsers</span></a> that are just a port of desktop browsers morphed into a compact form. No browser directs towards making the browsing experience unique for smartphones. But, here’s when Cake’s intervention shakes things up.</span></p>
<p><span>Based in Utah, Cake Technologies Inc. is a venture-backed startup founded in 2016 that focuses on providing the best experience from a browser.</span></p>
<p><span>What is the most important function of a browser?- To search for things using search engines like Google, Bing, etc. However, according to a study by Moz in 2016, when searching on a traditional mobile browser, it takes 87% longer to find and click on a relevant result as compared to desktop browsers.</span></p>
<p><span>What Cake does is, instead of displaying a list of search results from search engines, it presents them in a card format all loaded up so that you can get to the most relevant result’s content directly. The next two results are loaded in the background so when you swipe over to them (as it’s a card format), they are already loaded. This way you won’t have to scroll, scan or involve in back-and-forth navigation while searching for your favorite kind of animal. The folks over at Cake have named this feature “Index suppression.”</span></p>
<p><span>The browser also optimizes pages from its side to enable faster load times. With that said, pages with a faster loading speed in a search result are given the most preference. So, even if a page ranks top in search results in a traditional browser, it won’t rank first in Cake browser if it won’t have the best load time and relevancy.</span></p>
<p><span>Another notable feature from Cake is group search. It groups your search results into one media type which is chosen by you. For instance, if you are looking for earphones to buy, you can type in the term “earphones” in the URL bar and then tap on the shopping cart indicating you want search results for shopping. The browser will automatically display all the results from Google’s rankings that lead to shopping earphones. Further, it loads up shopping sites like Amazon, eBay, etc. by the side so you can always swipe over.</span></p>

<p><span>Cake browser, just like its name, uses delightful colors all over the app’s interface. Mostly, the app has a mixture of references from Google’s material design and Apple’s huge titles- <a href="https://the8-bit.com/android-pie-released-for-pixel-phones-today/"><span>even on Android</span></a>. Even though there’s a lot of information and links being displayed on the screen, all at once, the browser’s designed in such a way that it doesn’t look muddled.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s best if I describe this browser as a combination of Safari and Chrome, but on steroids. Overall, the URL bar and the settings elements are plain, bold black and white, while the homepage is radically blue.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; line-height: 22.0px; font: 18.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span>Functionality</span></h2>
<p><span>This browser plays a huge part in terms of functionality. It contains a plethora of ground-breaking features that enable you to save a lot of time, and also stride through the internet effortlessly. I have already educated you on the basic idea that this browser works around. So, here are some more…</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span>Curation tools</span></h3>
<p><span>More than it’s a browser, it’s a content curation tool. And this becomes prominent as soon as you open the app. You’ll be greeted with links for the top 5 trending searches on Google for the day. When you tap on them, you’ll be provided with articles that justify the trending result. For example, it was the International Cat day yesterday, and upon clicking the trend, the browser loaded articles providing more information on the topic.</span></p>
<p><span>Somehow, Taylor Swift’s cats got a mention everywhere…</span></p>
<p><span>Slices is a pretty neat feature that comes packed in with the browser. Basically, it shows you the headlines from all the major websites depending on the topic you select.</span></p>
<p><span>How you do it is, you open a new tab, tap on the genres available at the top for the Slices feature, and the browser will load the homepage of every website related to that genre. For instance, if you tap on “Gaming,” the browser will open relevant news websites like IGN, Polygon, etc. It’s a superb feature if you want to discover more websites, and get to know different points of view.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span>AdBlock and Security</span></h3>
<p><span>Cake browser’s core functions are similar to every browser available for the mobile app market. However, as I said earlier- the app’s on steroids. It comes along with a built-in ad blocker that blocks ads on any and every website you visit. Although, there is an option to disable ad block just in case if you want to become generous towards websites.</span></p>
<p><span>Besides, on every website, the browser indicates if it has SSL encryption or not. This helps you stay away from the ones that could <a href="https://the8-bit.com/online-privacy/"><span>potentially harm your data</span></a>.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; line-height: 22.0px; font: 18.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span>Customization</span></h2>
<p><span>This browser supports customization than any other browser in Android as well as on iOS combined. For starters, you can customize which websites you prefer in terms of search results. For example, while searching for headphones, you want search results from eBay first instead of Amazon, you can change the preference in the swipe-down results after you search for a query.</span></p>
<p><span>On top of that, Cake also lets you change the app icon with about 20 options to choose from.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also decide upon which search engine to use, and you can change it anytime you want. But, the default is Google.</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve been using Cake for about a week now, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to any other mobile browser, let alone Safari and Chrome. But, that is only unless either Apple, Google or Firefox introduce the same or better features. Well, I haven’t told you about the best part about this browser yet: It’s 100% ad-free.</span></p>
<p><span>However, it’s not always so sweet in Cake land. There was one time when the browser faced connectivity issues, where pages would load painfully slow. Other than that, the app was fluid as hell. And it certainly changed the way I browse- a way which I couldn’t ever have imagined.</span></p>
<p><span>The Cake Browser is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cake.browser&amp;hl=en_IN"><span>Android</span></a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cake-web-browser/id1163553130?mt=8&amp;at=1000lGtS"><span>iOS</span></a> as a free download.</span></p>
