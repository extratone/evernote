His listlessness - sometimes taking the form of the <span style="font-style: italic;">can't buy happiness</span> trope, but actually of a much more innately antisocial nature - is his weakness, but his ultimate misconception/miscalculation is that he thrives on the same confusion/chaos/inconvenience that he sews, when in fact his &quot;own medicine&quot; quickly leads him down dark annals of self-abuse that catch him off guard more often than they should. Also rather classically <span style="font-style: italic;">Billionaire Playboy</span> is his life philosophy: &quot;do whatever it is you need to do to have cumulatively experienced as much <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span> as possible when you lie down for the last time,” and - also rather classically - he struggles, like Blimp, to maintain control over how he feels, despite the vast well of resources at his disposal.</div><div><br/></div><div>He is inherently obsessed with identity because his own is built on an almost-spiritual reverence for agitation of the stagnant in all walks of life. This reverence has - with his years - replaced that of genuine originality as he has grappled with his faith in its existence (as is standard for just about everyone in his demographic.) He is much more agitator than terrorist, but his life is a fundamental examination of what really separates the two, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">his true crucible will be reckoning with the possibility that it's all in fact in the interest of the greater good</span>. Underneath everything - if you were to sober him up and cleanse him completely, for instance - he is restless and furious with his inability to recreate the intensity of youth in his day-to-day experience.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">His real anomaly is: after having an essential attachment broken, instead of grieving, his soul just... trails off... But he still has his amusements</span>, and he continues to depend on them completely for his general well-being, the definition of which - for him, specifically - is the most perplexing, alluring issue in focus. Tharp is the only one sharp enough in his life to truly perceive beyond any barriers he's been capable of erecting in front of this conflict, and it is when he realized as such that he did everything in his power to keep her at his side at all times. She was the first and only thing on Earth that he feared.    </div><div><br/></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">His drug use has yet to</span> <span style="font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45;">truly</span><span style="line-height: 1.45;"> fall off the deep end, though he could afford it, now, but he has yet to yield in his quest to feel things deeply (like Barney.) Spiritually, even, though the term is not present in his unironic vocabulary. Though far from alien, his process is unique enough to render him relatively unaffected by the mechanisms at the top of the common human toolbox to which we go first to deal with such inner contradictions, so he has always lived under the assumption that it was up to him alone to figure out himself (unlike Barney, who - for a time, at least - had the companionship of the Loss with the others of The Limon Six.) Lily's existence is a direct challenge to this assumption, and has been slowly, inadvertently unraveling bits of him, but he has - so far - not yet come close to losing track or letting slip. He will maintain his </span>equilibrium for the forseeable future. It is a challenge, but it will not be his tragedy.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">At his best</span>, he is original, quick-footed, and profound.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">At his worst</span>, he is impulsive, careless, impatient, hasty, and explosive.</div><div>    His intense hatred and disgust for hippocracy, in particular, leads him to speak and act publicly against easily-justifiable targets, but also the less justifiable ones, too.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><br/></div><div>-If interviewed on television, Pith wears a white shirt that says &quot;today is [incorrect date.]&quot; in bold black text.</div><div><br/></div><div>-Pith's Pork Playpen / Pith's Chili Trough (the only businesses he’s changed the name of upon acquisition.)</div><div><br/></div><div>-Gunning down live hippos in the nature sanctuary on live television (<span style="font-style: italic;">GMA in Africa</span>)</div><div><br/></div><div>-<span style="font-style: italic;">Obsessed</span> with home printing. &quot;The best part about having lots of money is being able to print <span style="font-style: italic;">as much as I want</span> of <span style="font-style: italic;">whatever I want</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">whenever</span> I want.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>-Instructs in rotation every quarter one of his newspapers to choose a member of their staff to write and publish their own obituary.</div><div><br/></div><div>-Hosts regular at-home card games, which he maintains a grand facade of being excellent at, when in fact, he knows nothing.
