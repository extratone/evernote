He came to the rescue when the young people were unavailable to record <i>Futureland</i>, and we ended up signing him up for his Twitter account on the show, which was entertaining. We began recording our Hunter S. Thompson episode of <i>Off The Grid</i> a few days ago, but ended up dancing around the topic because of the much-anticipated appearance of Alexa (Anne Thracks,) who has contributed two superb works of prose. You're gonna wanna keep your eye on her - she's got that voice pretty well mastered.</div><div><br/></div><div>We also mentioned Tim's unusual plan for 2017, and it now has a (placeholder) title - <i>The Endeavor.</i> Columbia, Missouri - where <i>Extratone</i> headquarters is cordoned - is an achingly-moderate college town full of adderall-hauling students and dull, middle-aged fucks who think themselves <i>awfully quirky</i>. Beneathe all moderate places, though, is a cultural counterweight of some kind, and ours is an unwholesome underground of sexual deviancy.</div><div><br/></div><div>Before I go on, let me be clear: <b>we are not here to expose anything</b>. We are not investigative journalists or zealous truthists - our <i><b>only</b></i><i> </i>desire from this undertaking is for good stories.</div><div><br/></div><div>Using friends' networks and Craigslist, we intend to spend two thousand, seventeen actively delving into local fetish communities as much as possible. Though I say &quot;we,&quot; I must note that this is Tim's vision &amp; vessel, through and through. It is his to steer where he wants, though I will be tagging along as much as I can. Along the way, he will be posting stories on <i>The Endeavor</i>'s roll, which will be compiled afterwards into a book.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ultimately, neither of us can anticipate what's coming, and we should all be grateful. Scribam quid non legerim - it's gonna be a helluva ride.</div><div><hr/></div><div>Our new Production Editor has been putting in more than her Fair Share. Emily wrote the <a href="http://www.extratone.com/words/waters/screwloose/">first</a> of her <i>Poems and Peroxide</i> series. My hope is that her straightforward method will provide substantial relief from my mealymouthed ramblings - both written and spoken. Her participation in <i>Futureland</i> has been helpful, though she did spill french fries on the floor of <i>Studio Eat.</i></div><div><br/></div><div><i>The Movie Closet</i> finished their four-part &quot;favorites&quot; series and recorded a fascinating &amp; concise discussion with the crew behind <i>Under The Glass</i> - a local documentary about the history of pinball. Their <a href="http://www.extratone.com/audio/moviecloset/christmas/">Christmas Special</a> is vastly superior to the other holiday-edition podcasts I've heard, as well.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Regardless of the results of just about any possible happening in the next month (except for my own death, perhaps,) the next <i>Freq Check</i> you receive will be vastly different from this and all prior correspondence.
