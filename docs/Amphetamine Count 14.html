<span><div><h1>Amphetamine Count: 14</h1></div><div><h2>Smoking and Ubering all over this goddamned town.</h2></div><div>It looks like I found a friend in Josh - a young j-school student who’s just interviewed me regarding <i>Extratone</i> for a profile assignment, which he apparently intends to follow up on. One who understands and responds to my infinite media industry-related conjecture, which is cherishable in and of itself. I’m rather amused at the thought of journalism professors reading/hearing about my <i>ideological</i> and <i>naive</i> undertaking.</div><div><br/></div><div>It’s doubtful much more will be done for the site, this month, but the rest I’ve gotten spending time with Eryn will prove beneficiary, I think. I did write <a href="http://bit.ly/smutsleaze" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i>Lacky Sleaze</i></a> in general frustration with Columbia and the people my age (men, mostly) who seem to <i>literally</i> &amp; <i>obviously</i> want nothing but to fuck. We’ve also been going pretty hard on <a href="http://extratone.com/anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Anchor</a> - today is the first <i>Footwork Friday.</i></div><div><br/></div><div>I’d been meaning to show Eryn what I’ve <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/AsphaltApostle/1OdKrygYYvVxX?t=50m41s" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">added</a> to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/sultry" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">her song</a> on a more substantial instrument than my upright or keyboard for a while, and we finally managed to sneak into the music school to find a practice room with two identical Yamaha uprights. It’s important for me to play when sleep deprived (hence that one time I actually <a href="https://soundcloud.com/digivoid/asleep" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i>fell asleep</i></a> on tape and continued to play.) As I understand it, the brain is less and less able to determine what is and is not relevant information. If I add adderall to the mix, I get much more eloquent (often pretentious) in everything I do - improvising, driving, writing, talking, etc.</div><div><br/></div><div>Keeping in mind the context of an improvised session - it allows me to <i>find</i> more when I’m <i>searching</i>, if that makes any sense. My interactions involve both conscious and unconscious decisions, but they’re better when the latter is as great ‘a’ portion as possible.</div><div><br/></div><div>The prime room with the full Yamaha grand was taken by a student practicing Bach, which is quite stressful to overhear, as you might imagine. I thought we were settling when we backtracked to the double-upright room, but the instruments themselves proved to be sublimely dynamic considering their orientational affliction. </div><div><br/></div><div>My ‘performance’ itself was adequate - I think I accomplished what I went to do - but the highlight of the experience began when Eryn started playing around. She just started rhythmically pressing different keys in exactly the same way I first did as a toddler. For whatever reason, I’ve never actually had the opportunity to improvise/add around somebody playing this way, and it was <i>unimaginably delightful</i>. A Real Hoot.</div><div><br/></div><div>I’m often asked by siblings to ‘teach’ my nieces and nephews how to play, and the method I briefly tried with Eryn is the only one I’d apply (which is why I’ve refused.) All I did, really, was guide her own exploration. </div><div><br/></div><div>The most important debacle regarding piano ‘lessons’ is whether or not the potential student <i>actually wants</i> to learn, and it’s answer is found in how he/she/they behave when they’re sat in front of an instrument. If their fingers are not drawn to the keys - even after a wait, and/or some time left alone with it, perhaps - there’s not much to be done. If you <i>actually</i> want somebody to “play like me,” that is.</div><div><br/></div><div>I’ll spare you my entire spiel romanticizing improvisation and instead refer you to <a href="http://bit.ly/referencetradition" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i>Listen</i></a>, which I wrote almost a year ago about a local who I’d find, often playing Columbia’s downtown public piano. It’s an image of a musician in the aftermath of a rigorous academic musical curriculum: exceptionally talented at reproducing the works of others, but unable to listen to the music inside himself. </div><div><br/></div><div>Of course, your incentives depend on how you measure yourself. I know plenty of trained musicians who are very proud of their technical mastery - it’s those few who observe my relationship with longing (like the subject of the poem,) that need(ed) to be told, perhaps.</div><div><br/></div><div>Anyway. Playing with Eryn was a real joy - I’ve never been able to share my relationship with the piano that way, before.</div><div><hr style="width: 100%;height: 1px;font-size: 1px;border-bottom: 1px solid #c1c7cd;display: inline-block;"/></div><div>In other petty news, Nevermore is officially Out Of Action after its starter solenoid stuck, causing it to run constantly no matter what I did - even without the key in the ignition - until it burned the motor out. As much as I love my car, the funds needed to get it back in Proper Working Order - now some $3000, at least - are not within a reasonable savings goal in the foreseeable future, especially considering my <a href="http://bit.ly/freq10" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">plan</a> to depart for the Northwest next Spring. </div><div><br/></div><div>Or at least, that’s what I’d been thinking. Now, I’m wondering if it’d be good for me to try doing the work, myself. I definitely <i>do not</i> have that <i>thing</i> that makes mechanics/technicians exceptional at figuring out how to fix most anything. It’s one of those incommunicable-but-immediately-apparent aspects of life. On my farm, I did have experience rebuilding/restoring a 1948 Ford 8N - the subject of <a href="http://bit.ly/feeblespdf" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i>To My Little Tractor</i></a> - but uh… things have changed, for one. I don’t have much option, though - at least as far as the starter is concerned. The car is immobile, without it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I’ll don a white t-shirt and my last pair of <i>Ricky</i> jeans and hope the endeavor will fit well with my recent <i>return-to-origin</i>-themed existence. I also took my first Uber, and was a bit <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/873182360363204608" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">too fascinated</a>, but trading Ye Olde Jaguar for ride-sharing services will surely help reduce my <i>Actual Age</i> (A.A.) statistic.</div><div><br/></div><div>[VIDEO]</div><div><br/></div><div>A few nights ago, two girls came in to the station rolling on molly, big time. Naturally, they were absolutely fascinated with me and stole my phone to take a <a href="https://youtu.be/pmrVPelvhRo" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">snap</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>I have continued my experimentation with Mary Jane, thanks to Eryn’s company, and was able to get a few fairly-humorous observations down while high. (No, it is not cannabis journalism, though <a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/high-times-legalization-news.php" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this story</a> did remind me of its existence, notably.)</div><div><br/></div><div><i>I remember shapes of the things in the hallway? in between the garage and the house. I think I remember a specific smell and image of Grandpa's minivan. I see</i> <i>&quot;</i><i>99&quot; indicated on the digital speedometer?</i></div><div><br/></div><div><i>Now smells and heats from a boyscout summer trip</i> <i>-</i> <i>the shower and the phones? I obsessively swept the restroom area.</i> <i>(</i><i>It was not a building</i> <i>-</i> <i>it was open to the air.)</i></div><div><br/></div><div><i>The sound of the trees moving in the wind standing close to the house on the North side, for ~2/3rds of a second.</i> <i>(</i><i>That's something BMIs may be sophisticated enough to archive for me before I die.)</i></div><div><br/></div><div>I wish it was easier to retain memories of the sensation, but - as I’m sure you know - those side-effects dealing with memory, itself, are incredibly difficult to capture. It’d also be nice to retain… anything, really. I <i>do not</i> like losing time. </div><div><br/></div><div>Speaking of which: I have just found what is now my <a href="http://antiquetractorblog.com/2015/05/25/why-i-love-the-8n-ford/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">favorite listicle of all time</a> searching for images of the 8N to include. Is this <a href="https://twitter.com/RachelGingell" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">young woman</a> who blogs about tractors the Long Lost Love I have been searching for?</div><div><br/></div><div>The career, of course, not the individual. If <i>Extratone</i> fails to mature parallel to myself, and I reach a position allowing me to violate my death pact with the website, at least I have tractor blogging to fall back on. </div><div><br/></div><div><i>Don’t let me forget the relic of the John Deere 45</i> <i>combine outside of Eryn’s hometown.</i></div></span>
