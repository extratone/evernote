<span><div>On May 18th, 2016, I launched a despicable-looking WordPress website, satisfying nobody’s anticipation but my own.</div><div><br/></div><div>The 367 days since have been the most significant of my entire life.</div><div><br/></div><div>I have learned more, produced more, and slept less than ever.</div><div><br/></div><div>Though many people have added to this project financially or intellectually, its greatest beneficiary so far has been myself by a wide berth. In the next year and beyond, I need your help to make sure that changes.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can imagine (almost <i>hope</i>, even) that these letters haven't had much readership, but they've forever chronicled my intellectual and emotional development in spite of my shife, fleeting memory. Writing to you has assisted me tremendously in figuring out why and how I should build this thing.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Today, the</b> <b><a href="http://extratone.com/ty">front page</a></b> <b>bears nothing but the above list of individuals who've invested in, contributed to, bantered with, and/or encouraged us.</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Beneath their names is a heavily smushed screenshot of all the <i>Extranet</i>'s raw text. It's a bit less compressed than the one I posted <a href="http://bit.ly/tonedistilled">on Instagram</a> - the original was 30,000 pixels long - but they both allow you to see the entirety of what we've created so far in one image.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>The staff and I would like to thank</b> <i><b>you</b></i><b> for your readership, your engagement, and your support of fresh digital media.</b></div><div><br/></div><div>If you recall our mantra - <i>scribam quid non legerim</i> (&quot;I will write what I have not read&quot;) - note that an unstated component of that sentiment includes <i>I want to</i> <i><b>read</b></i><i> what I have not read</i>. In that sense, our supporters - mentioned and unmentioned - have directly contributed to our satisfaction, as have you - even if these are the first of our words you've consumed.</div><div><br/></div><div>Colleagues and friends have come and gone, but the core group - the people I chose to bet on - have remained present in some form, and the work of every one of those who've chosen to move on will remain in high standing.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Editorially</b></div><div><br/></div><div><a href="http://twitter.com/extratonemarx">Tim</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hawthorn_jr">Hawthorn</a> have become my right and left hands - keeping me in cheque in their own distinct, respective methods when my pretentious abstractions begin to cross the line. Over the months, they have thanklessly assumed a critical counterweight role, and one of supreme friendship, personally. I'll never be able to express sufficient gratitude to either.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>The three of us now make up the editorial team of this publication:</b> one damaged-goods word nerd, a chaotic, prose-slinging machinist, and a maniacal cybercountess.</div><div><br/></div><div>Nullify Tim's company, here on the ground, and I'm not sure I'd be able to maintain my obsession, functionally, and without Hawthorn's sporadic correspondence from the Northwest, I'd have spun off in a cyclone of my own bullshit, ages ago.</div><div><br/></div><div>Aside from her appearances on <i><a href="http://extratone.com/futureland">Futureland</a></i>, I know 'Thorn's <a href="http://www.extratone.com/author/hawthorn/">byline</a> seems awfully absent, but her behind-the-scenes contributions have had a significant impact on decisions made within virtually every aspect of the organization. This is why - very soon - I'm going to be overhauling our woefully-outdated <a href="http://extratone.com/staff">masthead</a> to more accurately compile and present the names who make up <i>Extratone</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>In fact, I've already begun building staffer-specific landing pages: Tim and I have <a href="http://extratone.com/cactus">/cactus</a> and <a href="http://extratone.com/bilge">/bilge</a>, respectively.</div><div><br/></div><div>Given the below-detailed commitment against compromising our visual experience, <a href="https://twitter.com/BennyBeats111">Ben Stokes</a>' ambitious new bi-weekly <a href="http://bit.ly/harveythalloway">web comic</a> could not have been pitched at a more perfect time.</div><div><br/></div><div>My <a href="http://bit.ly/godfuck">rant</a> about Facebook is mostly conjecture - the language of its users - but it actually includes pseudocitation(!) and looks really great.</div><div><br/></div><div>I happened to glance at the <i>Net</i>'s recent top searches, a few weeks ago, and discovered mention of 'brandon from extratone' behind only my name.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Top Searches Screenshot</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Who is he? <i>I</i> certainly did <i>not</i> let any Brandons in the front door.</div><div><br/></div><div>Our anonymous digital wraith - K. I. Eleutherios XVII - decided to explore the story in her <a href="http://bit.ly/deadbrandon">exposition</a>.</div><div><hr/></div><div><b>Mechanically</b></div><div>Remember that fucking business plan I told you about <a href="http://bit.ly/freq11">last month</a>? Well, number two has taken <i>a lot</i> of my time. Originally, I only wanted a web presence to easily manage the content for eventual seasonal prints, but what I've learned about digital storytelling in the interim has me convinced that its possibilities trump the need for you to ever hold us in your hands. Personally, it's been 12 months of obsessively stumbling around, which is an odd activity.</div><div><br/></div><div>In retrospect, it would seem that I've learned to turn my vanity into productive energy. Remember that night in <a href="http://bit.ly/freqcheck2">July</a> when I spent some 18 hours completely redesigning the site after I'd happened to visit it on my phone before bed? I thought <i>this... looks like shit</i>, so I just... threw everything away, and started over with the basic infrastructure of today's <i>tone</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>Our server experienced 2.1 million raw hits, and 4200GB of raw bandwidth exchanged by 32,500 unique visitors. 210 posts and 71 pages containing nearly 100,000 words make up over 12mb of raw Extranet text - 12,753,703 characters, or about four King James bibles.</div><div><br/></div><div>So, our <i>Trato</i> has indeed grown into that titanic digihunk I predicted it would, but it's actually gotten very lithe over time. At origin, the whole <i>clunky-ass intranet</i> thing was a good joke, but I'm <i>very</i> pleased to announce that it (along with its registration process, forums, profiles, groups, etc)  has been destroyed, forever. The loss of its dead weight coupled with a near site-wide elimination of the sidebar has reduced the <i>net</i> to less than half its original loading time.</div><div><br/></div><div>Also contributing to this newfound immediacy in a big way is the visual style we devised in November of last year, which we like to call <i>Pithed</i>. Like a sort of cyber blackout poetry, it involves compressing <i>the shit</i> out of ultra high-dimension images upon render so that they look beautifully and intentionally pixelized (as opposed to just plain poor quality) at ludicrously tiny file sizes.</div><div><br/></div><div>For example, <a href="http://www.extratone.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nerds.jpg">this featured image</a> I took at MAGFest is 4672 x 2628 - more than large enough to be malleable for the <i>Extranet</i>'s various display formats, yet the JPEG, itself is only 120 kb in size, which allows for even the longest-winded, most intricately visual-laden features to be briskly rendered in less-than-ideal network situations.</div><div><br/></div><div>Of course, it wouldn't make sense for us to <i>sacrifice</i> our reading experience to page load times - that's what old new media is for - but I think Pithing will continue to have a smoothing effect on your digital thumbing, along with its resulting lack of caching necessity. In fact, there was actually a significant <i>increase</i> in overall site speed when I disabled it to live-edit something a few weeks back. (Remind me to buy a 10-gallon hat for such occasions.) Until a more tailored professional solution becomes available, the <i>Extranet</i> will remain <i>live</i> and <i>uncached</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>Out of all forms of human communication, the comic format has always been the most alien to me, by far. When attempting to absorb a comic book - print or digital - I've never been able to escape my utter ineptitude. (I'm sure I'll be able to improve after some experience, one day, but for now, the fact is inconsequential.)</div><div><br/></div><div>In the case of Ben's <i><a href="http://bit.ly/harveythalloway">Harvey T. Halloway</a></i>, I was provided an enthralling new challenge just in the nick of time. When he originally submitted <a href="http://bit.ly/harveyone">Page 1</a>, I simply chucked most of the raw image on the homepage. Apparently, some mobile browsers do not allow pinch-to-zoom in that format, and ya can't just take every panel in at once on a smaller screen.</div><div><br/></div><div>The most reasonable, short-term solution I could come up with was to install <i>Harvey</i> on <a href="http://extratone.com/harvey">its own instance</a>. I pulverized a free theme's CSS (which is why navigation appears quite glitchy, at the moment,) and mustered a bare-bones platform that seems to function adequately for the time being. The <i><a href="http://extratone.com/halloway">Halloway</a></i> section on the <i>Net</i> is still the best way to browse and share pages, though. (The entries are simple redirects.)</div><div><br/></div><div>If you're an experienced consumer and you've got the time to send your feedback, <a href="mailto:davidblue@extratone.com">please do</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>My early focus on user account registration exemplifies how disturbingly profound my naivety was regarding the state of the internet in 2017. I knew enough to avoid anti-open web CMSs like Medium or Tumblr, and to foresee a universal re-analysis of <i>where the fuck our words go</i>, (and I just needed to play around again,) but I had no idea how many brilliant internal communication solutions were available.</div><div><br/></div><div>Nor did I realize the extent of the noise which one is now confronted with when attempting to create a media company. A primary quandary all along has been sorting between <i>what is expected</i> (of a digital magazine/blog/news site,) and <i>what makes sense</i>. It's a particularly essential one - the answer will likely decide the relevancy of our existence.</div><div><br/></div><div>For instance, <a href="http://bit.ly/extratone">Discord</a> is basically capable of everything that any/all communications services have ever offered, yet even the most modern publications are still using Slack, internally, which is simply unnecessary. Most of the web looks like shit, including those few publications with <i>way too much money</i> to concede to <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/">fucking mobile versions</a> of their sites and their readership's <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/04/the-french-magazine-lobs-is-using-facebook-messenger-to-follow-undecided-voters/">Facebook habit</a>, while others have stooped to just <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/on-future-of-8766185">treating their audience</a> like five-year-olds.</div><div><br/></div><div>If <i>Extratone</i> was subject to this cowardice, we'd probably have a significantly greater revenue stream by now, but we wouldn't be making anything worthwhile. It'd be senseless.</div><div><br/></div><div>Though it's been sporadic - and <i>much</i> too male - there are people visiting this website. We've gotten some mud on the tires, and the experience has suggested that non-contributor user accounts are senseless. There's no reason for you to worry about <i>another</i> set of credentials - another opportunity to put your information at risk, or for <i>me</i> to have to worry about putting it at risk.</div><div><br/></div><div>As such, I have <b>disabled account creation</b>, removed the [nib] drop-down menu from <i>Meta</i>, and finally <b>disabled comments, site-wide.</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Methods of engagement with us <a href="http://www.extratone.com/contact/">still abound</a>, and would-be contributors can simply <a href="mailto:davidblue@extratone.com">email me</a> to have their account made. It's a lot simpler this way.</div><div><br/></div><div>My gift to the <i>Extranet</i> for its first birthday is this version - 3.6 - which includes a bunch of additional tidying-up with that <i>digital flipping</i> ideal in mind. (I'm just thankful I've yet to have a dream - or nightmare - about editing the website.)</div><div><br/></div><ul><li>The search function has been removed from <i>Hustonia</i> - the main nav menu. There really <i>is</i>  something about &quot;online magazine&quot; and the necessity of <i>exploration</i>. Take your time - you might have fun digging. If you <i>must</i> search, you'll still be able to use the functionality in this format: /?s=[term]. E.g. <a href="http://extratone.com/?s=piss">extratone.com/?s=piss</a></li><li>Most sections (categories) have been re-visited and irrelevant meta trimmed away as much as possible. It doesn't make much sense for every thumbnail in <i>Words of David Blue in Red</i> to include &quot;by David Blue.&quot;</li><li>Archive display pagination has been revised. There are now a set maximum number of posts-per-page displayed, so - if you find yourself remembering something you found while exploring, you can reliably remember where you left off by page number.</li><li>I tweaked the <a href="http://extratone.com/about">about page</a> slightly, removing parallax to further smooth things out.</li><li>Since it's still debatably the best part of this website, it's worth noting that I've visually updated our <a href="http://www.extratone.com/aaaaaaaa">404 page</a>.</li></ul><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>[Zenon]</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Tomorrow, I'll be saving all server contents to a flash drive, which I'll place in a local safety deposit box. Though it's probably a bit of an archaic tradition in 2017, I'm sure it'll feel cool, and grant me at least a smidge of further reassurance.</div><div><hr/></div><div><b>Audio</b></div><div>Despite taking on the undoubtedly monumental task of drawing a bi-weekly web comic, Ben Stokes has continued to plug away at <i><a href="http://extratone.com/moviecloset">The Movie Closet</a></i><i>.</i> You can now spread the show around more easily with this shortlink: <a href="http://bit.ly/moviecloset">bit.ly/moviecloset</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>Tim bought a Nexbit Robin and reviewed it on <i><a href="http://bit.ly/futureland27sc">Futureland</a></i><i> </i>before we caught up on a bunch of stories, and I read the <a href="http://bit.ly/disneyclass">first piece</a> I wrote for <i><a href="http://bit.ly/vilechrist">Words of David Blue in Red</a></i> in honor of its one-year anniversary for <i><a href="http://bit.ly/drycast58">Drycast</a></i>.</div><div><hr/></div><div><b>The Past</b></div><div>Since these letters have really just been another, long-winded form of <i>Extratone</i> aggregation, it's prevalent of me to revisit some of <i>my</i> favorite content from the past year.</div><div><br/></div><div>In early October, we watched the Second Presidential Debate between Clinton and Tump, and I was able to get our very-liberal friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ivy_hollivana">Ivy Holivana</a> to chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/virgyvirgil">Virgil</a> - <i>Studio Eat</i>'s Marxist guardian angel, and <a href="https://twitter.com/notalekmichael">Alek Michael</a> - <i>Extratone</i>'s Alacrity Editor and singular Donny-voting staffer. It was published under the now-deceased <i><a href="http://bit.ly/offthebone">Off The Grid</a></i> brand, but was like nothing else we'd ever done. It's a bit of a surreal listen, considering where we're at, currently. There was a lot of interruption, but everybody was able to articulate their particular, universally-fresh perspectives on <i>The Tump Problem</i>. Nothing much has become of our hesitant <i><a href="http://extratone.com/tump">Tump</a></i> section yet, but that discussion is the essential takeaway.</div><div><br/></div><div>The first episode of <i><a href="http://bit.ly/casiochastity">Futureland</a></i> to bear the name included an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/PornUniversity">Glenn</a> of Vine fame, but discussing his excellent <i><a href="http://apple.co/2pVNenj">Expert Opinion</a></i> podcast ‘out-of-character,' as well as his dilligent study of comedy proved to be much more interesting than the service's destruction.</div><div><br/></div><div>Way back in September, I got to record a <a href="http://bit.ly/domanark">conversation</a> with a podcaster whom I've admired for a long time. <a href="https://twitter.com/DomanarK">DomanarK</a> co-hosts <i><a href="http://cluelessspacenerds.com/">Clueless Space Nerds</a></i>, an <i>Eve Online</i> community icon which I used to consume religiously. It's no surprise we got along so well, I guess - ultimately, we are both Midwestern rednecks who've played the goddamn game.</div><div><br/></div><div>We started off this year by attending <a href="http://extratone.com/magfest">MAGFest</a> 2017 - our first event 'coverage' as a publication. Though we only got a <a href="http://bit.ly/magfest2017">single episode</a> of <i>Futureland</i> from the floor, itself (in the corner with the trash and the flies,) a later, much more sober <a href="http://bit.ly/cyberbogan">reflection</a> in the aftermath recorded with Whitney, Jab50Yen, Kali, Isiah, and Juni proved to be an effective followup. Though it's only been a few months, the <a href="http://bit.ly/magspectacle">written bit</a> - my first attempt at a &quot;big feature&quot; - is already quite cringey in layout and voice, but perhaps that's a positive thing. I may finish its companion - <i>The Sincerity -</i> one day when I have time to kill, but the experience taught me - if anything - just how irrelevant most of my presumptions were. Rounding it all up, Jab50Yen and I had a <a href="http://bit.ly/drycast56">conversation</a> about YouTube Poop to a depth I can safely claim as the premiere offering, anywhere, which is uh... very <i>on-brand</i>, at least.</div><div><br/></div><div>Alexa's extraordinarily articulate rants in the last fifty minutes of <i>Futureland</i>'s <a href="http://bit.ly/sorghumfuture">22nd episode</a> are some of my favorite of all time. Imagine if we had the means to pay her for more rants and <a href="http://www.extratone.com/words/prose/siblings/">hard-hitting prose</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>The <a href="http://extratone.com/prose">whole section</a> has been great, really, but Tim's <i><a href="http://www.extratone.com/words/marx/sons/">sons</a></i> is probably my favorite.     </div><div><br/></div><div><b>The Future</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Of everything?</div><div><br/></div><div>Terrifying</div><div> </div><div>because it is more complex than any of us could've imagined.</div><div><br/></div><div>There will be exponentially more information to absorb than the combined exchange of all human communication, and our methods of distributing it will be (and are being) brutally tested, but ultimately, the message is <i>always</i> more important than the medium.</div><div><br/></div><div>I've brought you along for my experiences returning to (somewhat) worldly awareness because this context - what you see in front of you - is the only method I've found for myself to accomplish both the academic and personal development that university exists to accomplish (by declaration, anyway.) Obviously, I'm grateful for the personal progress, but the danger of my person on its future has made itself apparent. Ultimately, <b><i>Extratone</i> cannot be me; cannot be <i>mine</i></b>.</div><div><br/></div><div>I've been learning to love this town, but it's <i>far</i> from where we belong. As I explained in <a href="http://bit.ly/freq10">March</a>, we're planning to head toward our friends in the Northwest, next year - conserving our community building energies for a more target-rich environment. Early on, I was adequately convinced that face time (as in, person-to-person) was no longer necessary for intercommunication for the 'truly-modern' organization I wanted to build, but - as I've said repetitiously - my perception of even our own bubbled industry reality has changed drastically, since.</div><div><br/></div><div>No amount of VoIP, text channels, or file sharing services can replace proximity in the process of a publication <i>flying the nest</i>. An office space will always be the ideal environment for our sort of collaboration.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's really all I daydream about, these days.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can tell you that I, myself need to slow down a bit, while I still can. A year of <i>web development</i> has gained me plenty of knowledge, yes, but it's also cost my body a lot. The groundwork has been laid, and I've been slowly acclimating to a more reasonable lifestyle.</div><div><br/></div><div>There's always more to say, but it can be left to the coming months. Until then, we're going to continue doing our best to deliver extraordinary digital experiences, and we hope you find yourself invested in our creation.</div><div><br/></div><div>One more time - thank you. For everything.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Scribam quid non legerim</i></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>When I hid away to polish <i><a href="http://bit.ly/Feebles">Feebles in Night</a></i> for publication in the Winter of 2015-2016, I let myself slip into the quiet spaces of my hometown to an extent I hadn't approached since adolescence. I'd made a point of watching changes - of making sure I was the most informed in the room, and - after being faced with a total reallocation of life priorities - I realized that I could not foresee a single possibility which I <i>wanted</i> from my environent. For the first time in my life, I found myself completely without a reason to be here.</div><div><br/></div><div>After my crucible in January 2015, I'd spent most of a whole year drunk, in cowardly retreat. I read and wrote old things, on used, yellowing first-edition paper and leather-bound journals. When I found myself away from alcohol and the noise, fidgeting away with the manuscript, I realized that all they'd done was <i>delay</i> my grief. In the quiet, it hit me, and took over everything, for a while. I could sleep for days at a time, and I'd wake with little-to-nothing on my mind.</div><div><br/></div><div>Eventually - after a few weeks - I had my first chance to look at <i>Feebles</i> as a whole from a wider lens, and I saw that - while I was proud of it - the only substance it had to offer was its overall critique on the cliche human ideals of <i>peace</i> and <i>silence.</i></div><div><br/></div><div>The whole time - all of my adult life, really - I was an intellectual witness to a huge number of friends on Twitter who were creating and consuming a culture which I'd never been exposed to, in the flesh. Explicitly and implicitly, they'd been showing me music I'd never before heard, art I'd never before conceived of, and sentiments which I'd assumed were impossible. It was all stimulating - often, just because it was entirely new, but it was also <b>noticeably undercovered</b> by even the institutions that claimed to revere the <i>fresh</i> ideal.</div><div><br/></div><div>I began to see mirages of the divide, and started looking in to what was possible on the web for the first time in a decade. There was a conclusion that <i>Feebles</i> had led me to, and it was steadily rising from the back of my mind: <i>It is in death that we find the ultimate</i> peace, silence, <i>and</i> apathy, <i>and the opposite of these is</i> <b>noise</b>, <i>therefore, the founding principle of</i> <b>life <i>and</i> youth</b> <i>can be measured in decibels</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>I thought back to high school, when my friend would show us the strangest, most deviant music he could find, and we would gawk. Extratone is a sort of subgenre of gabber, created during a time when producers were competing on the speed of their kicks. Of course, the multiples do </div></span>
