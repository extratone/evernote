After a second conversation between Isaac and Tucker, Joseph prepares to warn Isaac about Tucker's possible lies, but Tucker kills him before he has the chance in the field next to the big tree.  This is the first Amish man to die at the hand of Tucker's special seed-gun weapon.  Before, Tucker had disguised his Amish kills as hatecrimes.  Joseph, though, is left lying in the field with a huge hole in his torso.  This signifies the beginning of the true all-out war on the Amish waged by Monsanto.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Outline</strong></div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene 1 - Broadway Diner - Night</strong></div><div>Tucker begins with a really far-fetched metaphor comparing locusts with the amish people's struggle.  &quot;Locusts can carry 3 million times their body weight in grams&quot;</div><div>Isaac and Tucker leave the diner and part ways, Tucker goes to his truck, Isaac goes off camera.  The into credit music starts as Tucker drives back to the secret headquarters in his truck.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene 2 - CPA (Cyber Purification Agency [pronounced &quot;spa&quot;]) - Night (after drive from Diner)</strong></div><div>Tucker's behavior has completely changed.  Stoic, cold, plotting.  DRAKE is introduced.</div><div>&quot;Plowed him, all we gotta do now is plant the seeds.&quot;</div><div>-Short scene, not too much exposed.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene 3 - COLUMBIA DOWNTOWN - DAY</strong></div><div>Isaac calls his sister (Gabriela) on his iphone, scene transitions to her home, she answers on wood block phone.</div><div>&quot;What it do&quot;</div><div>Isaac is coming home from out of state...talking to his sis like what it do</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?1 - CPA - TIME UNKNOWN</strong></div><div>Compsci students return to the CPA and Drake programs them to go back out and terrorize the Amish community</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?2 - SOMEWHERE IN AMISH LAND - TIME UNDETERMINED</strong></div><div>Isaac is having dinner with his Amish family to showcase how FUCKING DISCONNECTED he is with his family....food is weird though like Korean and taco bell tacos with the taco bell bags still there but the bags are like from 1997.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?3 - Monsanto Scene</strong></div><div>After Tucker kills Phil Mallard...he makes a cup of coffee, gets a call.  In the midst of the call, goes to Phil's corpse in the corner, takes his keys, then drives his mercury mariner to st. louis</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?4 - Tucker's Great Philosophical Speech</strong></div><div>At some point (perhaps some of the men under Tucker are starting to doubt the Amish genocide,) Tucker needs to give a long Galt-like speech detailing the problems with the Amish.  In reality, he doesn't really care enough about &quot;humanity&quot; or social ideas enough to have this opinion, but essentially, he claims that the Amish's refusal to participate in society makes them a dangerous threat to the future of mankind.  He rules them to be outliers...&quot;no individual that is so removed from our well-defined and established system of social hierarchies or one that could sustain such an existence should remain alive.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>The Amish are &quot;too extreme&quot; and &quot;arrogant to think that they could just refuse to participate in the agenda of the rest of humanity.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;If these people make the choice to ignore the common goals of the rest of humanity...how can they be human?  If THESE PEOPLE can existence in such a deviate state from the status quo, are they not sick?  Are they not on the same moral ground as a serial killer or a genocidal dictator?  No, <em>these people</em> are not <em>people</em> at all, they're animals.  And what do we do to pests?  Do we let them gnaw at the foundation of the society we have built when a cheap and effective method of their eradication is available?! No!  We eradicate them!&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?5 - Isaac Cleans Out the CPA</strong></div><div>-Lights are off in the CPA, we see a silhouette silently killing one agent after another, eventually the lights come on and the entire room is just one bloody / gore mess.  They're all unimportant.  All in cubicles.  It's Isaac doing the killing but we don't know that.</div><div>-After the lights come on, there's only one man left, camera zooms in on gore mess for a few seconds, shows the variety of methods Isaac used to kill everyone, then we clearly see Isaac sneaking up behind this terrified / frozen man.  We don't actually see Isaac kill him though.</div><div><br/></div><div>These people in the cubicles could be minions of Drake's...this place is almost like a hatchery for compsci majors.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?6 - Tucker Shit Cop</strong></div><div>Tucker is driving along...perhaps obviously going above the speed limit??? when sirens are heard and &quot;blues + twos&quot; are seen in his rear view mirror.</div><div><br/></div><div>Tucker knows he's going to get a ticket, but he calculates that the cost of replacing his pants and cleaning up the car would be less than that of a speeding ticket, so he shits his pants (literally.)</div><div><br/></div><div>When the officer approaches the window, he can obviously smell the shit and Tucker says something like &quot;I'm sorry officer...I had to use the restroom really bad&quot; and the cop says something like &quot;wow, you <em>did</em> really shit your pants, didn't you?&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>NEW IDEA</div><div><br/></div><div>Monsanto meeting scene with round table...tucker discussing the operation with monsanto execs...they're scared of him...intercuts with Isaac family scene, also around similarly shaped table, and his family is disconnected.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?7 - 30 minute confession</strong></div><div>Voice recorder confession, Isaac gets it from Tucker, but they have to scroll through all the shuffling and waiting because digital voice recorders are shit.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Scene?8 - Family Man </strong></div><div>-Doesn't have to necessarily be relevant to the plot, just Don spewing shit over the phone to his wife/kids.</div></span>
