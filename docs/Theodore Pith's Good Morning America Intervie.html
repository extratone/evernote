<span><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: Here with us in the studio this morning is Theodore Pith, author of his new, quite controversial but hot-selling book - especially here in New York, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Are Varieties of Cheese: How Your Foodism Will End Everything</span>, and the new owner of the renamed Manhattan BBQ joints, Pith's Chili Trough and Pith's Chili Playpen. We've got what looks to be a... Ha ha, well... a miniature trough of chili right here in front of us. A lot to dive into, for sure, but first, Mr. Pith... Your book seems well, directly opposing what I see and smell in front of me. That is cheese on that chili, right?</div><div><br/></div><div>Jake Jingles holds the obnoxiously-bound volume upright for the camera to see, but has his hand over the nude, cheese-covered woman drawn just beneath the title.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: Yes, that's an understandable contrast to make, Jack. First, I'd like to say how wonderful it is to be here above the beautiful Time Squared... Wow! You guys have a great audience. Hiya, folks! Love you guys! Don't be shy - get your hands dirty! It's Chili Day!</div><div><br/></div><div>Pith waves dumbly at the crowd behind the camera, who cheer and whoop in response. The cameraman cuts to the cheering a bit obviously late.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: Well, there it is... You've gotta love that humor! Was it part of promoting the book, buying these restaurants or was the timing just a coincidence?</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAIME JANGLES</span>: And has the tour got you jetlagged, or was your shirt part of the promotion, too? What kind of a shirt is that?</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: First of all, yes that is true, free-range American cheese grated into your chili, there... I'm actually going to start digging in, if you don't mind.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: No, of course... I think I'll join right in with ya.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: I, myself, really don't find the book's argument in conflict with my love of chili, particularly.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: That argument being - as I understand having read as much as I could last night - that our obsession with food is... Well, sortof rampant and infecting our culture-</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: ...and stealing attention from important efforts in policy, charity, et cetera, yes, but when you do finish the book - and I really hope you do, George - you'll have been taken through my conclusion, which is, essentially, that it's our delicious, gluttonous, organic Rome's time to fall, if you get my drift.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAIME JANGLES</span>: I have to say... I haven't gotten to read the book yet, but I really love my me food - I happen to know that Jake, here, loves his <span style="font-style: italic;">even more</span>, and it's hurtful - the suggestion that my interest in food is somehow malicious-</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: ...oh James! Don't look so bashful! Please, eat your chili!</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAIME JANGLES</span>: I'm Jaime, actually-</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: ...oh shit, I'm so sorry! That's really embarrassing... Jaime, please let me make it up to you - have some of <span style="font-style: italic;">my</span> chili!</div><div><br/></div><div>Jake and Jaime cringe and trade sideways glances at the profanity. A trickle of gasps can be heard from the audience.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: Hey, now! This is a live family show, Theo-</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: ...gosh, I am so sorry guys. </div><div><br/></div><div>Pith looks into the camera, mouth, hands and shirt covered in brown. Weak applause and laughter comes from off screen.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: Kids, you should know that profanity is nothing by the byproduct of laziness. True eloquence is-</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: ...tell you what, let's just get back to the book, alright?</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: Sure, sure... It's really exciting to see it finally going off the shelves after all these weeks, you know. Writing something like this is grueling stuff.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAIME JANGLES</span>: Wow, yes, I can't even imagine. How long did the process take, do you know?</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: At least three... Yeah, three weeks or so, last November I think it was.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jaime and Jake both <span style="font-style: italic;">wow</span>.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: That's actually... really no time at all... Really quick. It's nearly 500 pages, right? And this is your first book?</div><div><br/></div><div>Jake stiffly began to manipulate the bright-orange volume again turning it over, very deliberately assuring that the cheese woman be excluded from the shot.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: First <span style="font-style: italic;">published</span> book under my own name, ya know. I've written a few other things, here and there, but that's a subject for another time.</div><div><br/></div><div>The studio audience <span style="font-style: italic;">awww</span>s.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: Sure, we'll have to have you back some time.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jake smiles with visible grit.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: But, this apocalypse... Is it happening now? Soon? A hundred years in the future? Or...?</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: All three, really. We are here eating scrumptious, fifty-dollar chili while unprecedented numbers of people are starving, all over the world - in Haiti, Namibia, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Detroit... And yet we demand only the cleanest last few decimals of a percentage from the food on our own tables.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAKE JINGLES</span>: A striking thought.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">THEODORE PITH</span>: Quite. And that was the idea, but it's also important to note - not to give too much away, I hope - that Rome's decline is inevitable, despite what hope we all love to swaddle ourselves in, and thus we might as well enjoy what we have so far achieved, yes?</div><div><br/></div><div><b>JAIME JANGLES</b>: Well, I'm glad you brought this chili with you... It <i>is</i> quite an achievement.</div></span>
