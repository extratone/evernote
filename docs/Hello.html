I was listening to the radio a few days ago - NPR - and happened upon an interview with a young man from Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute.* He mentioned a study he'd done on the populace's fear of the future. 
<div><br/></div><div>His findings were unsurprising repetitions of attitudes we've all heard from the working class. They were scared of the &quot;computer takeover,&quot; the sci-fi android revolt, of Siri ever having an interest in their well-being. He found their distrust of nearly any advanced automated process unwavering. 
<div><br/></div><div>In his very last moments on air - the part after the real discussion where the host and guest lifelessly chuckle at each other and attempt to look like buds - he tagged out with something like &quot;the one exception </div><div>is in cars. People seem okay with the idea of self-driving cars.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>What a funny joke! I laughed. My industry is the one in which an automated future is a-okay. Not that the public's fear matters anyway - historically, radical technology is always adopted - just slowly, gradually, and lubricated by a few generations.</div><div><br/></div><div>And I don't fear automated vehicles, really, because the resources for any sort of large change in this country's basic system of road infrastructure must come after the current problems are dealt with first - mundane things like congestion, potholes, etc. </div><div><br/></div><div>What I <i>am</i> afraid of is the public's complete lack of awareness. The culture has car companies chasing electric cars - when anyone who knows anything knows that battery technology is shit and always will be shit. Meanwhile, humanity's only potential savior from petroleum dependence in automotive applications - hydrogen fuel cell technology - is more or less neglected.</div><div><br/></div><div>And yes, the United States has a great history of collective big dreaming, but it's always been toward the future - like...big rockets and woodstock. Battery-powered, plug-in-the-wall-socket, 100-mile-range, 10-hour-charging electric cars are the past. I'm not saying this out of some miserable sense of social obligation or concern for the general welfare - I'm saying this because it has a great potential to impact my future standard of living; please shut the fuck up and give up on batteries. </div><div><br/></div><div>That, you'll find, is a recurring theme in my writing. Whatever part it is of the human brain that contains the incessant, undying need to take care of the entire species - I don't have it. Of course it's not an organ and it's not something you're born with, but I'm sure I'll be getting around to that all too often in future dictation.</div><div><br/></div><div>If you read any automotive media, you've been hearing the same alarm for decades now - that cars are losing their soul and becoming appliances built by appliances. Lamborghini is now German. Bentleys are now Volkswagens. The dominant vehicle of the landscape is designed in the East and built in the third world.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's true, yes. Cars are finally <i>just transportation,</i> as they were designed to be. </div><div><br/></div><div>Or are they?</div><div><br/></div><div>To those insisting motoring enthusiasm is dead or dying I need cite only one statistic: <i>Top Gear</i> is still the most watched television program in history.</div><div><br/></div><div>Of course you can hate cars and still enjoy it, but the point is that more people accept their role in everyday life globally than they accept Frasier's. For those of us that live in industrial society, they are inevitably much more than <i>just transportation,</i> simply because of how present and necessary they are.** This will be so as long as they exist in their present form.</div><div><br/></div><div>So, why then is this blog entitled <i>The End</i>?</div><div><br/></div><div>Well, you may have noticed the U.S. Census Bureau widget on the <font color="#FF0000">drywall homepage</font>. Yes, it's a very funny joke, but it's also a sort of standard of living-o-meter. You'll see me write about overpopulation a lot - this is because it is simply the origin of all the problems humans believe themselves to face as a species, and a pretty good indicator of how I will be living in the future. For now, let's just say more people means less good stuff for David Blue - like polished walnut dashboards, fine timepieces, isolated estates, over-engineered coffee shops, etc.</div><div><br/></div><div>Owning a car is still considered a luxury by most people on Earth, or at least that's what they tell me. Given this, you can imagine what an impact exceeding the planet's effective carrying capacity will have on the automotive world. Of course, it's clear that the carbon fiber track day energy drink GoPro crowd won't be dying out for awhile. (I'd imagine they'll at least survive my lifetime.) However, they and their cars are no longer...cool, if you see what I'm saying. </div><div><br/></div><div>For instance, I doubt Ken Block has much to say about feminism - assuming he'd know what you were talking about if you asked him - and that is an absolute nono if you want to be a cool guy in 2014. One wonders if Mr. Block could function alone in society at all, actually.</div><div><br/></div><div>Not that I'm qualified to sum up the 2010s like I can sum up the 1950s. (Weapon-derived hair products, post-agricultural punks, drive-in movies, the missionary position.) I can tell you though, that cars aren't really cool anymore. Nothing retro is really cool, it has to be smartly pseudo-retro. You have to come up with a good explanation for why you're raiding your neighbor's trash and hanging it on the wall. I can't claim immunity to this - I'm very vaporwave and want to steal a sign that says &quot;EXPANSION JOINT HERE&quot; for my bedroom door.</div><div><br/></div><div>Living in an old renovated city house with your cats and like...bicycle parts everywhere, that's cool. Driving a 1969 Camaro is not cool - that's for dads.</div><div><br/></div><div>Of course, the latter is much cooler to more where I live because the blue collars really do outnumber the decoupaged. I owe them a hat tip; it makes things much less miserable.</div><div><br/></div><div>Society does &quot;grow up,&quot; though. Even the bluest of collars will one day despise the automobile one day, if there are any left, or at least think back on their existence as just an adorable primitive necessity - a blunder, and that's saddening to think about.</div><div><br/></div><div>Rampant and frankly obscene government intervention and regulation combined with with the cover fire from academic America's now post-automotive culture have really put the new stuff in a bad sort. It's not a particularly illuminating example, but if you've been dead the past 20 years, <font color="#FF0000">my recent 2015 Chevrolet Impala review</font> should help you understand just what I'm talking about.</div><div><br/></div><div>Everything is a throwback, it's always &quot;after.&quot; The names are mechanically meaningless now, the companies have succumbed to globalization. There is no room for real competition - for open strides. Now, you've done a good job if you've managed to create something that only slightly breaks the law by the end of the day.</div><div><br/></div><div>It is for these reasons, more or less, that I have decided to call this blog <i>The End.</i> I'd rather you not steal it because, frankly, it's just about the best name for anything I've ever come up with, being bad at naming things.</div><div><br/></div><div>I should state now (because I can,) that I do not believe these changes to be good or bad. There will be positives and negatives for me, but it is the inevitable course for the buying public, and that's just how the market works.</div><div><br/></div><div>For the enthusiast, the future is uncertain. With more people getting further and further from the process of operating their vehicles, there will inevitably be &quot;more room&quot; for us to grow more focused - for the pleasures of motoring to become more special and specialized. More gas for us, I suppose?</div><div><br/></div><div>I, beginning my professional prime and belonging to no publication, will be observing this transition to...whatever it is.</div><div><br/></div><div>*Yes, <font color="#FF0000">it actually exists</font>. </div><div>**<i>Poor urbanites, guess you guys think about buses a lot? Tragic.</i></div><div>(We've all heard the same negative afterthoughts about &quot;robots building cars&quot; now, of course.)</div></div></span>
