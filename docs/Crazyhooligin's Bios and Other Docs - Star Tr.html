         Kuvak, a Vulcan male, was born on the starship <i>Excelsior</i>, on September 9th, 2292.  The name of his mother is unknown, but it is known that she died from natural causes immediately after giving birth to Kuvak.  He was adopted for a short while by Ambassador Shras, one of the Federation Ambassadors to Andoria.  <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	On February 2nd, 2293, Ambassador Shras reluctantly gave up Kuvak when the <i>Excelsior</i> docked at Starbase One.  He was then formally adopted by Carol Evans, a 55-year-old widow residing in Philadelphia.  She raised him as her own, and he accepted her as his mother.  As a child, Kuvak showed many traits typical of a Vulcan child, although he was not at all raised around Vulcan culture.  This presented many obstacles, including being rejected by his Vulcan peers later in life.  Kuvak was never trained to fully suppress his emotions, and therefore had many problems as an adolescent.  <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	When Kuvak was 14 years old, his mother sent him to a monastery on Vulcan for 6 months.  There, thanks to the help of an unnamed friend, Kuvak learned to suppress his emotions down to a manageable level, without suppressing them completely.  Unfortunately, when he returned, Kuvak was informed that Mrs. Evans had suffered an unexplained kidney failure 3 months into his journey, and died as a result.  <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	Kuvak lived for years regretting his actions toward his mother before his departure to Vulcan.  After returning, Kuvak grew restless.  For almost 2 years, he wandered around the Planet, getting involved with various criminal organizations along the way.  Eventually, Kuvak came to his senses and realized that he was simply longing for a means to occupy his scientific mind.  <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	In April of 2309, at the age of 17, Kuvak enrolled in Medical School at the University of Missouri.  He graduated valedictorian of the class of 2312 with a doctorate in Medical Science.  Immediately after his graduation, Kuvak enlisted in Starfleet as a Cadet, and enrolled in Starfleet Academy.  Kuvak spent an unusually long time at the Academy, the opposite of what he had done in Medical School.  He founded the Starfleet Academy Museum Ship program.  He and 65 other cadets crewed the then newly restored NX-04 <i>Discovery</i>, on a 2-year tour of the Federation, educating children of all Federation members on Starfleet History. <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	For this achievement, he and his fellow Cadets were credited with many awards, and he was commissioned into Starfleet as a Lieutenant Commander, officially graduating in 2318.  While waiting for his first assignment, Kuvak spent two years at the Krusemark Institute of Psychological Research in Lincoln, Illinois, where he developed a method that prevented infants from contracting Attention Deficit Disorder without altering any genetics.  This earned him a Presidential Medal, and a promotion to Commander. <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	On January 27th, 2321, Commander Kuvak was assigned as a a senior Science officer aboard the U.S.S. <i>Hathaway</i> (NCC-2593,) at the age of 29.  He was promoted to First Officer of the <i>Hathaway</i> in 2329, but was shortly given command of the U.S.S. <i>Bataan</i> (NCC-92815-B,) <i>Constellation</i> class, on June 15th, 2330 (Stardate: 7454), and promoted to the rank of Captain.<br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	Although he certainly did not have the usual command style of Vulcans, Kuvak was an excellent leader, and instantly liked and respected by the majority of those under his command.  Despite his being clearly more human than Vulcan, many Vulcans came to respect the balance of emotions and logic that he had acquired. <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	On April 29th, 2361 (Stardate: 38324.2), the <i>Bataan</i> encountered an anomalous comet near the Romulan Neutral Zone, which had unusual magnetic properties.  Although it was thought to be safe to study, a catastrophic antimatter containment failure was caused by a rapid pole reversal of the comet.  Luckily, all 372 crew members were able to escape before the ship suffered a Warp Core Breach. <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	The <i>Bataan</i>-B was not able to be salvaged.  Luckily, one of many new <i>Galaxy</i> class hulls soon to be commissioned was assigned to the <i>Bataan</i>â€™s crew.  The U.S.S. <i>Bataan</i> (NCC-92815-C,) <i>Galaxy</i> class officially entered Starfleet Service on August 14th, 2361 (Stardate: 38659.1).  After a 3 month shakedown cruise, the <i>Bataan</i> resumed itâ€™s exploration duties.<br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	Between 2362 and 2400, Captain Kuvak headed the first contact of 13 species, 6 of which later became part of the Federation.  On November 23, 2373 (Stardate: 50895.4), the <i>Bataan</i> participated in the defense of Earth from the Borg probe that traveled back in time to attempt the assimilation of Earth in the past.  Unfortunately, the ship sustained heavy damage from the carrier Cube.  During the battle, a localized explosion on the bridge of the <i>Bataan</i> sent a large piece of shrapnel flying into Captain Kuvakâ€™s face across his left eye.  The wound was able to be repaired, although there is now a large scar crossing his left eye.  Unfortunately, the eye was damaged beyond repair.  He would later opt for an optical implant similar to those that Lieutenant Commander Geordi LaForge pioneered in the late 24th century. <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	On January 24th, 2409 (Stardate: 86064.8), the U.S.S. <i>Bataan</i> was recalled to the Vega Colony to assist in defending it against the Borg.  Also there, was Admiral Charles â€œCharlieâ€� Whatley, a long time friend of Captain Kuvak.  The Captain personally transported to the surface of Vega with 4 officers to help defend the colony against the Borg.  While he was on the ground, the <i>Bataan</i> and Admiral Whatleyâ€™s ship, the <i>San Francisco</i> engaged in a firefight with several Borg vessels that had arrived.  During the fight, a gravimetric torpedo struck a crippling blow to the <i>Bataan</i> that removed her from the fight.  The <i>San Francisco</i> was able to destroy all the Borg vessels, but it suffered a rapid depressurization of the shipâ€™s bridge, killing the majority of the commanding officers of the vessel, including Admiral Whatley. <br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	Given the circumstances, Starfleet promoted Kuvak to the rank of Rear Admiral, and gave him command of the <i>Sovereign</i> class <i>San Francisco</i>, which would soon be renamed U.S.S. <i>Bataan</i>, (NCC-92815-D) on September 7th, 2410 (Stardate: 87684.78).  The remaining crew of the <i>Bataan</i>-C and the <i>San Francisco</i> were merged.<br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/>
	On August 25th, 2410 (Stardate: 88255.34), then Vice Admiral Kuvak and Captain David Whatley founded the Starfleet Exploratory Division, an organization dedicated to preserving the original non-combat purpose of Starfleet.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br clear="none"/></span>
