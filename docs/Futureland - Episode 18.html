The sheer amount of shitty things that have happened is hard to grasp. Sitting here, in December, it's hard to remember the things that happened 12 months ago, in January of this god-forsaken year. It's important to look back, though, and so while this podcast is about the future, part of this episode is going to be dedicated to the past. At the beginning of each month, because this year has been an actual shit fest, we'll round up the celebrities who died in that month. </div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 18px;">January:</span></div><ul><li>Renault-Nissan says it wants to give us autonomous cars. 10 in the next four years.
