Ibrahim Coulibaly, My late Father was a well known Ivory Coast military leader. He died on Thursday 28 April 2011 following a fight with the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast (FRCI).</span></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><br clear="none"/></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">You can read more about my father in the link below:</span></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><div><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/28/ivory-coast-renegade-warlord-ibrahim-coulibaly" shape="rect" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/worl </a></div><div><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/28/ivory-coast-renegade-warlord-ibrahim-coulibaly" shape="rect" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">d/2011/apr/28/ivory-coast-rene </a></div><div><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/28/ivory-coast-renegade-warlord-ibrahim-coulibaly" shape="rect" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">gade-warlord-ibrahim-coulibaly</a></div><div><br clear="none"/></div></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><br clear="none"/></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment which I am receiving from my step mother. She planned to take away all my late father's treasury and properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father because my mother died during child birth and I was left alone with my step mother to take care of me. Meanwhile I wanted to travel to Europe, but she hide away my traveling documents. Luckily she did not discover where I kept my father's File which contained important documents like will and deposit certificate of my Father's fund which bears my name as the next of kin to inherit the money in his bank account. Now I am presently staying in the Refugee Mission Camp in SENEGAL. I am seeking for long term relationship and investment assistance. My father of blessed memory deposited the sum of US$ 11.5 Million in ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND with my name as the next of kin.</span></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><br clear="none"/></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">I have contacted the Bank to clear the deposit but the Branch Manager told me that my late father place an instruction on the deposited fund that I must present a foreign trustee who will help me in investment of the fund.</span></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><br clear="none"/></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">However, the manager advised me to provide a trustee who will stand on my behalf  for the transfer of the fund. I wanted to inform my stepmother about this deposit but I am afraid that she will not offer me anything after the release of the money because she threaten to kill me.</span></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><br clear="none"/></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">Therefore, I decide to seek for your help in transferring the money into your bank account while I will relocate to your country and settle down with you. As you indicate your interest to help me I will give you the account number and the contact of the bank where my late beloved father deposited the money with my name as the next of kin. It is my intention to compensate you with 30% out of the  total money after the transfer for your assistance and the balance shall be my investment in any profitable venture which you will recommend to me as I have no idea about foreign investment. Please all communications should be through this email address for confidential purposes, </span></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><br clear="none"/></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">Thanks in anticipation of your positive response.</span></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><br clear="none"/></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">Yours sincerely</span></div><div style="font-size: 12.8px;"><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">Miss Cynthia Ibrahim Coulibaly.</span></div><div><br clear="none"/></div></div><div style="caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>On Sat, Jul 14, 2018 at 1:12 AM, David Blue &lt;<a href="mailto:davidblue@extratone.com" shape="rect" target="_blank">davidblue@extratone.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><div><br clear="none"/></div></div><div><img src="My Dearest,_files/Image.jpg" type="image/jpeg" data-filename="Image.jpg" width="480"/><img src="My Dearest,_files/Image [1].jpg" type="image/jpeg" data-filename="Image.jpg" width="480"/><img src="My Dearest,_files/Image [2].jpg" type="image/jpeg" data-filename="Image.jpg" width="461"/><img src="My Dearest,_files/Image [3].jpg" type="image/jpeg" data-filename="Image.jpg" width="480"/></div><hr/><div>Dearest Cynthia,</div><div>I'm so glad you reached out to me. First, I'd like to ask you with complete sincerity to please do me a favor and read the entirety of this email and to seriously consider what I have to say.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>If you are who you say you are, I'm very sorry for your loss and your situation and I want you to know that I'm in contact with a friend of mine who's currently in Ghana for his work at Google to see if he could provide any assistance, and I've sent an email to my financial advisor inquiring about how I could proceed as a foreign trustee, though I don't expect a reply from her until Monday morning.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>If you are <em>not</em> who you say you are, I'm extremely interested in further correspondence with you. I am 110% supportive of email scamming - there are too many ignorant people with too much money in this country, especially. I'm very impressed by the time and craft your message represents and I'd love the opportunity to talk to you about it. I realize that this could represent a time-sensitive business for you, so I am willing to exchange the contact and demographic information (including email addresses) of at least 3 individuals (and possibly up to 1500) who I can guarantee are exponentially more vulnerable than the average recipient in exchange for the opportunity to ask you some questions about what you do. </div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>You may have actually hit a jackpot here: I still have an exported MailChimp list from 2013 on my external drive containing at least 1500 (mostly British) users from my time writing for <em>Speedmonkey</em> - a U.K. based website with an audience of <em>overwhelmingly </em>middle-age, upper middle-class white men who are generally kinda dumb about finances and geopolitics and I'm sure are unanimously horny.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>It's also really convenient for me to support this: <a href="http://www.speedmonkey.co.uk/search/label/David" shape="rect" target="_blank">http://www.speedmonkey.co.uk/search/label/David</a></div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>I can't promise this additional list quite yet because I need to think about how guilty I'd feel handing over their information but I have a personal reason to give you three names and email addresses right now - one of whom I know has bouts of generous mania and a history of falling for scams.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>If you're wondering why I'm so curious: 1) I run an independent online magazine (extratone.com) and I'm wondering how my email found its way to you. 2) I've maintained a particular interest in email scamming since my good friend read about the success of super-innovative Ugandan phishing rings in 2015 nabbing money from our least favorite demographic: rich, gullible, and tech-illiterate Americans. We legitimately considered traveling there to see if we could get involved. 3) It might sound ridiculous but I've wanted to write about email scamming as a new form of written art for a long time: Academic writing is in large part judged on its persuasiveness, so this sort of work is logically an even higher form.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>I realize that this is a lot and I really appreciate you reading this far. If you find yourself inclined to vett me, it should be especially easy: my whole life revolves around keeping my beliefs about technology and culture as public as possible. For better or worse, you'll find that I'm just a dork who's fascinated by technology and its relationship with culture.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>If you're uninterested or unable to get back to me for whatever reason, good job and good luck!</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>Thanks again,</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div><br clear="none"/></div></span>
