<span><div>My Nissan wheeltime for <i>Honk</i> has grown a massive respect for the brand's audacity within me. My interest in the profession has spanned years of maturity - from asking <i>can't you just...?</i> to active affection for those who dare reliably retort with a confident <i>no.</i></div><div><br/></div><div><i>Can't you just retire your body-on-frame SUV entries already like everybody else did 10 years ago?</i></div><div><br/></div><div>The noble, rugged Xterra, which we shall sincerely miss.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Can't you just follow the Golf's unquestionably low-risk lead into the tumultuous youth market?</i></div><div><br/></div><div>The Juke NISMO, which we regard as the industry's singular steady grasp on what <i>youth</i> actually means.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Can't you just take some cues from Honda and Toyota, and make your sedans easy on the eye?</i></div><div><br/></div><div>The Altima and the Maxima, which constitute what I personally believe to be the last truly <i>evil</i> marque available.<i><br/></i></div><div><br/></div><div><i>Can't you just step a little lighter on the Versa's margins? You'd be insane to build a car designed by MSRP!</i></div><div><br/></div><div>The Versa is - for better or worse - the absolute essence of automobiles' transportive function, and no more.</div><div><br/></div><div>And there's the GT-R, of course, which continues to make fools of <i>an entire culture</i> of self-titled &quot;gearheads&quot; who claim speed as their one true dowry.</div><div><br/></div><div>Throughout the years, Nissan has over and over again made me look like an absolutely absurd idiot for your display - and I cannot think of a better gift. Of all the brands to misunderstand, it is the ultimate muse.</div><div><br/></div><div>So, in the present, I am grandiosely assuming you are attentive enough to have been deliberating the possible outcomes of our time with the Murano CrossCabriolet.</div><div><br/></div><div>It was quickly apparent that the experience was not going to resemble our Night of the Juke in the slightest. Perhaps it can be attributed to my pre-game mentality. For the first time, I came to this monstrosity desperately hoping to be whipped again - real bad - but walk away with more closure than with which I arrived. Like a good diplomat, I made myself approach without want for anything but understanding.</div><div><br/></div><div>On first take, the Xterra was proud, and the Juke was clever. The CrossCabriolet is a corny joke. Take a look at an occupied, top-down example from afar. I cannot think of a more ridiculous picture.</div><div><br/></div><div>Just since its assembly in 2011, our example's trim had endured enough to begin disintegrating in a few bizarre locales. Not to overiterate, but needing strong mention: I had never sat in a roofless crossover before. I'm assuming you haven't, either. It is unnatural. It is harrowing.</div><div><br/></div><div>From the company I have summed so many times over the years as &quot;acutely ingenius&quot; came this... unsettling suburban bathtub.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's a shame - I repeatedly remarked on the extrapolated potential I could see, then, in a <i>roofed</i> Murano. Everything else in sight was worth my time. If only it had been better-protected.</div><div><br/></div><div>The sensation is simply ridiculous, in the sense that it'd be a tasteful joke were this a one-off project of some hearty garage tinkerer or tuning shop, but... my God. Nissan delivered it this way, and had the gall to ask over $10,000 more for their molestation.</div><div><br/></div><div>Still, its webpage (in past tense, thank God,) proclaims &quot;the Murano CrossCabriolet was the world's first and only All-Wheel Drive convertible crossover&quot; in the same language I'd tout the Xterra (may it rest in peace and eternally-insufficient glory) as the last available SUV, in the original use of the segment, or the Juke NISMO as the first competently-composed automotive product for millennial youth. Or the GT-R as by far the most high-value and effective instrument for the pursuit of maximum velocity across the ground. And so on.</div><div><br/></div><div>The language so assured, the parallels must inevitably be drawn to that cheap joke of the century's turn... the Pontiac Aztek.</div><div><br/></div><div>The details of its life story are reliably amusing, if you find yourself mid-research. From the journos' unanimous gasps at its corporately-edgy concept's unveiling to the weary original steed of <i>Breaking Bad</i>'s Meth Man, there is a similar <i>lifestyle vehicle </i>thread between the products that weaves an obscure narrative.</div><div><br/></div><div>My own contribution: after a missed exit outside Galveston just as Aztek's first became rentable, my stepfather (the most earnestly late-history Pontiac man who ever lived) took an entirely-unexpected and uncharacteristic 70 mile an hour plunge into the choppy grass median immediately after shouting &quot;this is an off-road vehicle!&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>As you can imagine, it was the single most traumatic event I have ever experienced as the passenger of a motor vehicle, but the damned thing was unscathed, despite having chucked us all (fully-belted) into its beige ceiling multiple times.</div><div><br/></div><div>Gary believed in Pontiac. Though he was keen enough to smell death, he chose to believe in the Aztek. And you know what? His faith, too, has made me look like an idiot.</div><div><br/></div><div>That's what separates the Aztek from the late CrossCabriolet: it really was a genuinely-<i>bold</i> innovation. Survive the laymen's idle party chat and crude design critiques, and you'll find an impressive clarity in its purpose, especially given the context of its conception. In the used market especially, it to this day represents a characterful, practical, and high-value consideration. And yet - at the expense of themselves - American buyers did not clamor for it like the informed did. Perhaps it was because the informed - like then-<i>BusinessWeek</i>'s David Welch - were echoing hopes of a &quot;design renaissance&quot; for GM. The renaissance that would not come until the Flush of the Boomer Higher-Ups some 8 years later.</div><div><br/></div><div>Both tales, I think, represent a profound neglect of consumer journalism. At the turn of the century, though, it was not unusual to go a day without internet access. Today, people are <i>still buying</i> the few flops the industry still offers - likely making the second-largest purchase of their life's current epoch - without consulting the <i>volumes</i> of diverse, intelligent, and articulate opining accessible instantly (now, for <i>free</i>) via the subsidized slates that lightly jostle in their jean pockets as they wiggle a signature on dealer paperwork. </div><div><br/></div><div>Funny, isn't it? An American hit when the Japenese were unquestionably winning, and - just over a decade later - a Japanese miss as their winning had just begun to be questioned. Make no mistake; I am not being patriotic. For me, sovereignty does not extend beyond design houses, R&amp;D buildings, and test centers.</div><div><br/></div><div>And it's somewhere within Nissan's where pillars were severed and delusions found; all astoundingly with executives' blessing. I am terribly and shockingly ashamed to report that my countrymen <i>actually bought them</i>. As many as 3300 units in the last year of the Mayan calendar. The worst bit, though, is that they <i>all</i> made their way to my particular part of the planet. I swear to the Sun - I am <i>surrounded</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>If you know Columbia, Missouri, it does not take more than a moderate imagination to comprehend the sense, as grueling as it is. I see them <i>regularly</i> - a few times a month. In a town where one can expect to spot a Gallardo in front of Buffalo Wild Wings marred by horrid plastic football miniflags wedged in its five-figure doors, they are everpresent reminders that the New Money Effect still continues to flourish, unbridled in the Midwestern U.S. The top is <i>always</i> retracted, of course, and the exposed driver is <i>always</i> a sweating middle-aged white woman wearing a light-colored tennis visor. She... <i>they... </i>are <i>always</i> on their way to a match. Doomed to roast forever, I suppose, as there is only one nearby court, as far as I know.</div><div><br/></div><div>It is disheartening to realize that, now, I see many more of them than Azteks around. Though neither were designed for a tangible <i>lifestyle</i>, per se, I am saddened by the shift this minuscule tell indicates in my hometown's morale. From an (albeit equally-vague) yearning for new adventure in an exciting new century to an emotionally-destitute jaunt to the <i>court</i>, I have witnessed all of Generation X's vigor erode procedurally away before my eyes.</div><div><br/></div><div>Y2K, Great Depression II, an ancient apocalyptic prophecy from one of the wisest civilizations in recorded history... <i>Surely, one of these disasters will finally End it All!</i></div><div><br/></div><div>Perhaps Nissan knew that even the well-read of the North American market were simply waiting to die. The number of unanimously-unbuyable prospects available has shrunk to virtually none, and the CrossCabriolet was not much of an investment; not all that highly-engineered, really. Perhaps they felt obligated to maintain some humor in the market. Perhaps it was all just an awfully-German prank. </div><div><i><br/></i></div><div>And, if the End of the World is imminent, why not lease <i>the world's first and only convertible crossover</i>?</div><div><br/></div><div>Why not play tennis?</div></span>
