1.     Tucker attempts to gain Isaac's trust at the Diner.
<div>2.     Tucker drives away from Diner, opening credits play.</div><div>3.     Isaac talks to his sister, Gabriela about the encounter with Tucker</div><div>4.     The next day, Tucker arrives at the CPA safehouse, inquires about the status of the cyber aspect of the operation from Drake (who is introduced here.)  Drake informs Tucker that the agents planning the operation to destroy physical records of the Amish had not given him an estimated completion time.  Tucker kills one of the agents (Phil Mallard) to demonstrate his seriousness in the operation to both the other agents and the audience.</div><div>5.     Tucker receives a call from Monsanto and immediately takes Mallard's Mercury Mariner to Monsanto headquarters in St. Louis for a meeting. In this meeting, the order to commence all aspects of the operation is given, and it's shown how scared all of Tucker's superiors are of him...Tucker is more himself in the boardroom than anywhere else in the movie...but it's made clear that he's still acting somewhat.  The plan for Amish eradication is being UNVEILED here.</div><div>6.     As Tucker is visiting Monsanto, Isaac visits his family for the first time in years.  Around the dinner table, Isaac's complete alienation from his family is shown.  They obviously can't even communicate in the &quot;same language&quot; as Isaac is speaking.  (He's interested in Amish rights and expansion, but his family can only see what is immediately in front of them.)</div><div>7.     That night, Tucker calls Isaac and offers reassurances and helps repair the emotional damage that Isaac suffers when he realizes the differences he has with his family.</div><div>8.     The next day, Isaac tells Gabriela the great news, and gets her a little excited too.  The word gets to Joseph Bowes.</div><div>9.     Joseph Bowes sets off to warn Isaac about Tucker out of guilt, but Tucker intercepts and kills him with his special seed-gun thing on his way to Isaac.</div><div>10.  The next day, Don Hawkins arrives on the scene of Bowes' murder...which is taped off. (USE BRENT'S DANGER TAPE). Does some Gibbs shit...witty, cynical remarks from an ex-special forces, alcoholic federal agent. </div><div>11.  That night...in a motel room, Don examines a posterboard (makes no real sense, but has something to allude to amish hatecrimes, has pins and string, think of Lundy's trinity board but without any order whatsoever.) </div><div>-Don is also researching on a laptop</div><div>-At some point, <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120621182946AAeGHEq">this yahoo answers page</a> comes up, Don ponders it (it's on his face.)</div><div>-Possibly a shot of Don smoking outside the motel room at night</div><div>12.  (The next day) Don questions members of the Amish community about the murder.  TUCKER and ISAAC are on a walk through the community and DON stops them to ask questions.  ISAAC does most of the talking....but DON now knows TUCKER's name.</div><div><b>SHITCOP SCENE HERE (taking isacc somewhere, calls monsanto after dropping isaac off)</b></div><div>13.  On the drive from the Amish community back to the CPA base, TUCKER calls someone at Monsanto and briefs them on DON's activities...he's figuring out things he shouldn't...getting a little too close</div><div>14.  (A scene that helps us get to know TUCKER more as the protagonist)  (<b>NEEDS TO BE DONE)</b> <i>THE DINNER SCENE</i></div><div>15.  Don gets a call from his boss at the FBI...he explains that the investigation is being halted...the case is being closed and declared an agricultural accident.  Don is ordered to cease the investigation altogether, but he protests.  </div><div>&quot;This is a little over your head, buddy.&quot;</div><div>&quot;We both know politics aren't your forte man.&quot; </div><div>The last thing the FBI boss says is &quot;When was the last time you drank?&quot;  Don answers &quot;Uh...maybe three weeks ago,&quot; and the FBI boss abruptly ends the call. (Later, the audio from this call is used as a reason to fire Don from the FBI.)</div><div>16.  At Isaac's house....Tucker and Isaac are at his coffee table discussing the night of the murder (need to determine a date,) Tucker begins the conversation saying he was speaking at AgCon 1998, lots of dialogue occurs, Tucker eventually screws up and says that he was with his kids.  Isaac is like &quot;Wait...&quot; with a slightly puzzled look..Tucker IMMEDIATELY pulls out his 9mm saying something like &quot;goddamn it&quot; or &quot;shit&quot; and fires a shot that actually misses Isaac.  He misses because the Amish (non-GMO) food upsets his system and blurs his vision.  Tucker runs around the house looking for Isaac but is too sick...has to retreat...leaves the house and drives haphazardly away.</div><div>17.  Tucker goes back to the CPA, he's sick, vomiting everywhere.  Everyone is there but they're too fucking scared of him to help, they just watch.  He walks to a closet or some sort of storage area and pulls out a jug of roundup.  Preps a needle / IV thing and injects it into his arm.  Immediately starts feeling better. Drake is there.  After a few seconds of silence as Tucker feels the roundup in his body, Drake says something like &quot;I've got something that'll make you feel better&quot; and he types &quot;Amish&quot; into google, the &quot;0 results found&quot; page pops up.</div><div><br/></div><div>Then manually types in the URL to the Amish wikipedia page and the error 404 message appears.</div><div><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Drake then mentions that some of the CPA agents are getting upset about what they're about to do...morale is low....Tucker eventually launches into his big speech. (see: <b>Scene?4</b>) </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The agents are mostly confused but they rally and cheer because they know that's what they're supposed to do in this situation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">18.  (continuous) - Drake screetches.  The gathering/audience of CPA employees is shuttled towards Drake, *they have no independent thought*  Drake places salad colanders on each of their heads.  Salad colanders will have RAM chips taped to them and a large antenna (CB radio antenna).  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">After the salad colanders are placed on their heads, the CPA employees move single file out of the CPA base. We then see them walk out on foot.  Various shots of different actors walking in various locations with the salad colander on their heads, accompanied by cinematic building music.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">19.  &quot;what are they going to do when they get to the amish&quot; <i>10 minute of Amish exploitation/horror</i></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-An old Amish lady is shoved to the ground by the colander agents as she walks through the amish community.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-CPA agents use the LEDs on their iPhones to terrify a group of Amish children.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-An amish man in his 40s is held on the ground while an iPhone is placed next to his head. On the screen, text reads &quot;MICROWAVE EMISSIONS,&quot; the agent holding the phone advances the slider (which is beneath it) to the far most right position through a red section labeled &quot;LETHAL.&quot; A whirring/spooling up noise is heard and his head explodes.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-A projector plays a TED talk on an Amish farmhouse, children run away in horror.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-Another projector plays a Ray William Johnson video on one side of a barn, while raw code is spraypainted on another.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">-Don Hawkins arrives and begins firing on the attacking CPA agents with his pistol. He calls the FBI for backup but they have abandoned him. He moves through the &quot;battlefield,&quot; (Amish are being terrorized all over the area,) aimlessly shooting agents. He comes upon a group of Amish cowering in a barn, a large group of CPA agents approaches.  Don picks off the first few with his gun but has to resort to fist fighting them.  In a lull, Don happens to look right and notices AN ARSENAL of modern weapons in this Amish barn.  He simply says &quot;alright,&quot; and begins slaughtering the agents.  He kills every last one, and the Amish survive, but they are severely weakened. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">20. <b>Isaac Cleans Out the CPA</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">-Lights are off in the CPA, we see a silhouette silently killing one agent after another, eventually the lights come on and the entire room is just one bloody / gore mess.  They're all unimportant.  All in cubicles.  It's Isaac doing the killing but we don't know that.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">-After the lights come on, there's only one man left, camera zooms in on gore mess for a few seconds, shows the variety of methods Isaac used to kill everyone, then we clearly see Isaac sneaking up behind this terrified / frozen man.  We don't actually see Isaac kill him though.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">These people in the cubicles could be minions of Drake's...this place is almost like a hatchery for compsci majors.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">21. <b>Family Man</b></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Don sits in his car in a bloodied shirt in a fast food parking lot.  Blood drips from his hand.  He's crying.  He calls Sally, delivers a heartfelt confession of his sexual frustration.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">22. <b>The Phone Call</b></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Tucker and Isaac speak for the first time since Tucker shot at Isaac (over the phone.)  This time, Tucker is himself, enjoying the sunset on a dock at the lake (described but not named in the screenplay) drinking gasoline from a wine glass.  This is the only time he states his real intentions in the movie.  He confesses that he will simply go wherever the money is, he doesn't care who lives or dies, and that the Amish philosophical and cultural opposition to Monsanto was merely an opportunity for him to kill. Isaac reveals to him that he has recorded the conversation, but has difficulty playing it back.  Lots of static is heard, as well as clothes rubbing together.  This part of the scene is strung out for minutes before Isaac gives up.  The FBI then jams his phone.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">23. <b>The Final Battle</b></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">The last scene</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">We begin with Isaac's full rage.  He's slaughtering CPA agents in all manner of gruesome ways.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">(specific methods to be determined at another time with help from brent)</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">The final battle between Tucker and Isaac is legendary.  They shoot hundreds of thousands of bullets at each other but still somehow miss. </div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">They weave in and out of pockets of CPA agents, Tucker not afraid to kill any one in his way, Isaac killing as many as he can without deviating from his quest to kill Tucker.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Don Hawkins is in a barn on their route and Isaac kills him as they pass through.  He is only on frame long enough for us to recognize that it <i>is</i> indeed Don, and to see that he dies.  We never see him again.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Tucker seems to start running away but he's actually making a tactical retreat.....The camera follows Isaac as we see Tucker come around the corner from behind a barn...IN A COMBINE with a grain head and whirling reel.  The camera zooms in on the set of reciprocating knives.  Tucker drives the combine closer and closer, following Isaac as he runs.  (If it's possible, shots of the combine at full speed chasing Isaac would be amazing.)</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Isaac escapes behind a building and Tucker loses him.  He opens the door of the combine, climbs down the first step of the ladder but then jumps off to save time...only to land on a pitchfork that Isaac had darted in with at the last second.  This is how he dies.</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br/></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">Isaac returns to the center of the community and faces one last push by the CPA.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">He kills them all mercilessly.  After the last man falls, he looks over the battlefield for a moment before turning to the group of Amish that stand behind him...one of whom is Gabriela.  They all look at him with terror and confusion.  He quickly raises his gun and we immediately CUT TO BLACK before it's to his shoulder.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;">SEE AUDIO NOTES - 2/13/2014 FOR BRENT SCENE IDEAS</span></div></span>
