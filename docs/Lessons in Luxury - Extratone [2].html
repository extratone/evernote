		<span style="border-radius:4px;display:block;font-size:63px;line-height:1em;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;padding:10px 20px;text-align:center;float:left;border:0px;outline:0px;vertical-align:baseline;box-sizing:border-box;color:#ffffff;background-color:#600906;">T</span>he marque I’d known for most of my life as “Cadillac” blended with the rest of the American auto industry – a culture that smelled overwhelmingly of <em style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;font-style:italic;">after</em> and ever-shorter leaps to grasp ideals that seemed so opaque amid the rotten brainflesh of that last bitter Detroit generation. Their prolonged refusal to die created an omnipresent state of ruin; an afterworld littered with endless rattling plastic parts bin trimpieces, sun-faded hood ornaments, and tired, oil-burning powerplants. Cars have always been the cultural expressions which I’ve understood most clearly, so coming of age at the turn of the century in the bleakness of the Midwest – where aspiration had all but abandoned – led me to believe that America was certainly in its last days, if not already just a twitching corpse.<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;margin-bottom:30px;word-wrap:break-word;"></p>
<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;margin-bottom:30px;word-wrap:break-word;">Everything was exhausted – the oil, the vigor, and the hope for anything better, ever. Meanwhile at home and in school, I was constantly reading about the <em style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;font-style:italic;">Golden Era</em> – the 50s and 60s, when everything was new. Having old parents fed it, too; both were born in 1950, and all of their favorite automotive experiences were at least three decades behind them.</p>
<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;margin-bottom:30px;word-wrap:break-word;"><em style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;font-style:italic;">Fifty-seven Chevy</em> was one of the first things I could reliably say.</p>
<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;margin-bottom:30px;word-wrap:break-word;">I went to classic car shows, thrasher’s unions, and vintage tractor pulls. A state or county fair was literally nothing to me without at least one of them.</p>
<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;margin-bottom:30px;word-wrap:break-word;">The only die-casts I ever paid any mind were all recreations of products designed before 1970, certainly.</p>

It came from a time when even agricultural companies had design departments. My Uncle helped me realize the dream on what must have been – in reflection – a very strange weekend visit. My cousin – his son – and I were about ten. He recollected later that I didn’t want to do anything remotely fun the night before; I just repeatedly spouted off abstracts about the history of John Deere until the 4020, and a few core specifications.</p>
<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;margin-bottom:30px;word-wrap:break-word;">In the morning, my Uncle brought me along as he carried the bodies of five dead hogs some distance away to their waiting mass grave in the mounted front loader’s bucket. It wasn’t a disturbing experience at all, though, just a mildly amusing curiosity atop the significance of my triumph.</p>
<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;margin-bottom:30px;word-wrap:break-word;">The object I dreamed most of owning was a John Deere Model A. I had a reprint of its owner’s and service manuals that I used to read on the toilet. They inspired some of my first stories. I also had a reprinted Corvette owner’s manual from 1961. I’ve probably owned more reprinted owner’s manuals than anyone under fifty, come to think of it.</p>
<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;margin-bottom:30px;word-wrap:break-word;"><img src="Lessons in Luxury - Extratone [2]_files/Image [1].jpg" type="image/jpeg" data-filename="Image.jpg" alt="thenewaandbseries" height="300" style="box-sizing:border-box;vertical-align:middle;max-width:100%;border:0px;height:auto;margin:0px 0px 20px;display:inline;float:left;margin-right:20px;" width="257"/>Even after my departure from rural life, I maintained an acutely pro-nostalgic sentiment until I went to high school, where I was told about the <em style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;font-style:italic;">rest</em> of the happenings in the mid-20th century. Because of my first real exposure to non-white narratives – and my total overexposure to the culture in childhood, the whole lot now makes me very uncomfortable. Fifty-seven Chevies give me the willies.</p>
<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;margin-bottom:30px;word-wrap:break-word;">I did not understand the function of music until I listened to black music. No exaggeration – feeling had never occurred to me before. My introduction to Houston rap culture came amid my abruptly-shifting image of the <em style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;font-style:italic;">olden days</em>, and had a profound effect on my development as a young man. UGK’s <em style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;font-style:italic;">Super Tight</em> was the first CD I was lent, Junior Year. It cast off my pilgrimage from the composed and sentimental truths of the East coast (which is an unquestionable cliche for the white suburban adolescent hip-hop enthusiast) to the noble, uncompromising aspiration radiating from the South, where I have and will forever remain.</p>
<p style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;word-wrap:break-word;margin-bottom:0px;">It’s difficult to articulate the relevance because I hadn’t come close to comprehending it until recently. We started off listening only because it was so <em style="box-sizing:border-box;border:0px;font-size:100%;margin:0px;outline:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;font-style:italic;">different</em> from anything around us; anything we’d ever known. What was an amusing fixation on excess became a clarion call for determination. In the most trying time of adolescence, I realized that the verses I’d heard as brags were proverbs – an exaltation of the human spirit which I had never experienced.</p>
